/**
 *
 * Provides a way to identify a user across more than one page
 * request or visit to a Web site and to store information about that user.
 *
 * <p>Cocoon uses this interface to create a session
 * between a client and the "cocoon server". The session persists
 * for a specified time period, across more than one connection or
 * page request from the user. A session usually corresponds to one
 * user, who may visit a site many times. The server can maintain a
 * session in many ways such as using cookies or rewriting URLs.
 *
 * <p>This interface allows Cocoon to
 * <ul>
 * <li>View and manipulate information about a session, such as
 *     the session identifier, creation time, and last accessed time
 * <li>Bind objects to sessions, allowing user information to persist
 *     across multiple user connections
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Session information is scoped only to the current context
 * (<code>Context</code>), so information stored in one context
 * will not be directly visible in another.
