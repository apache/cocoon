<samples name="Cocoon Samples" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">

  <group name="The Power of XML">
   <sample name="Hello World!" href="hello-world/">
    The complete separation between content and style
    leads to a very powerful multi-channeling solution where you can
    apply different stylesheets to the same content and generate different
    flavors of it.
   </sample>
   <sample name="XML-ized web sites" href="sites/">
    A couple of existing web sites have been xml-ized to show you
    how easier it is to handle pure-content markup.
   </sample>   
   <sample name="Presentation Slides" href="slides/slides">
    An example of more complex use of XSLT for navigation and content filtering.
   </sample>   
   <sample name="Internationalization (i18n) &amp; Localization (l10n)" href="i18n/">
    Since XML is based on Unicode, it can be used to encode all types of
    languages. Here is an example of the power of such an approach with
    the help of those i18n and l10n Cocoon facilities.
   </sample>
   <sample name="Syndication and Content Aggregation" href="aggregation/">
    Separation of content and style allows not only to serve your content
    in different ways, but also to syndicate, aggregate or otherwise transform
    content provided by other web sites.
   </sample>
   <sample name="Catalog Entity Resolver" href="catalog/">
    XML is handy but also very complex. Cocoon integrates a number of 
    facilities to help you during your journey through XML-land. One of these
    is the centralized handling of resolving network resources 
    (e.g. DTDs, symbols, character entity sets, images) to local copies through
    the use of catalogs.
   </sample>
   <sample name="XInclude" href="xinclude/">
     XInclude transformer sample. XInclude merges XML documents, or parts of
     them, into one document.
   </sample>
  </group>
 
  <group name="Web Services and B2B">
   <sample name="SOAP" href="soap/">
     Cocoon ships with facilities for immediate connection to SOAP resources.
     These examples show you how to connect to any web service with a few
     lines of XML markup.
   </sample>
   <sample name="Order Page" href="stream/order" xlink:role="dynamic">
     An example of B2B processing.

    <sample name="Virtual Portal Demo" href="webserviceproxy/cocoonhive/">
    A more sophisticated example including Amazon and OpenWiki. 
    Shows how a personalized
    portal can be built by connecting multiple remote
    services without writing a single line of business logic code.
    Only styling is used in addition to the proxy.

    NOTE: this will work only if you have included the documentation when 
    you built the web application
