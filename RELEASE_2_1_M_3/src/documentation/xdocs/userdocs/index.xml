 <s1 title="Overview">

  <p>In getting started with Cocoon, one must learn not only a number of
  concepts, but a number of details as well.  Read the Introduction and ensure that you
  understand concepts such as the sitemap, generators, transformers, serializers
  and actions.  This guide will fill in the details, such as "So how do I turn
  this query into XML data".
  </p>
   <p>If you are interested in developing real-world web-applications requiring
    form handling, authentication or even developing your own portal, have a 
    look at the <link href="../developing/webapps/index.html">web application documentation</link>.</p>
  <p>
  Come back often...this guide is being updated regularly.
  </p>

  <p>The actual user documentation is available from the side-panel.
