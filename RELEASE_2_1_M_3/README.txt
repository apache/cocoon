  What is it?
  -----------

  Apache Cocoon is an XML publishing framework that raises the usage of
  XML and XSLT technologies for server applications to a new
  level. Designed for performance and scalability around pipelined SAX
  processing, Cocoon offers a flexible environment based on the separation
  of concerns between content, logic and style. A centralized
  configuration system and sophisticated caching top this all off and help
  you to create, deploy and maintain rock-solid XML server applications.

  Cocoon interacts with most data sources, including: filesystems, RDBMS,
  LDAP, native XML databases, and network-based data sources. It adapts
  content delivery to the capabilities of different devices like HTML,
  WML, PDF, SVG, RTF just to name a few. Cocoon currently runs as a Servlet
  or from a powerful commandline interface. The chosen design of an
  abstracted environment gives you the freedom to implement your own
  concrete environment to suit your required functionality.
