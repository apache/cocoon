          <action dev="reinhard" type="fix">
            WebAppContextUtils stored a Spring parent application context in a static field. This
            made it impossible to reload the context. The static field was removed and a request
            for the parent context results in 
            WebApplicationContextUtils.getRequiredWebApplicationContext(ServletContext)
            which returns the parent Spring application context stored in the servlet context.

          <action dev="cziegeler" type="add">
            Each property reference can have an optional default value, like
            ${my.property.net:THE DEFAULT}. If no other definition for this
            property is found, the default is used.

            Add a bean map that collects all beans from the Spring context

            Improved the DefaultBlockResourcesHolder to act like a PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer.
            This allows access to the path of the deployed blocks in the configuration files
            through properties like ${org.apache.cocoon.blocks.[BLOCK_NAME].resources}.
