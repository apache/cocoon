    <title>Cocoon 2.2 webapp project artifact sucessfully started!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h2>Congratulations,</h2>
    <p>
      you have successfully started your own Cocoon 2.2 project based on the 'cocoon-22-archetype-webapp' Maven 2 archetype.
    </p>
    <p>
      The archetype that you used only loads a reduced set of components. It only includes the most important sitemap components 
      (e.g. the file generator, the XSLT transformer, the XHTML serializer) and Cocoon Forms and Cocoon Template.
    </p>
