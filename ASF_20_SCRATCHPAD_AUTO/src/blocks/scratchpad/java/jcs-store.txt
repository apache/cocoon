--------------
The files contained within are an initial implementation of the JCS store as
an internal persistent store for Apache Cocoon. More documentation on this 
can be found here:  http://jakarta.apache.org/turbine/jcs/

The AbstractJCSStore class belongs with the Avalon-excalibur-store implementations, 
to compile, A-E-Store needs to have the following in the dependency file:

         <dependency>
            <id>JCS</id>
            <version>1.0</version>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <id>commons-lang</id>
            <version>1.0.1</version>
        </dependency>
         <dependency>
            <id>commons-collections</id>
            <version>3.0</version>
        </dependency>

You may need to compile, and make JCS available within the Maven repositories.

The JCSPersistentStore class implements Parameterizable, and has the following
xconf config:

<persistent-store logger="core.store.persistent">
   <parameter name="region-name" value="indexedRegion1"/>
   <parameter name="group-name" value="indexedDiskCache"/>    
   <parameter name="config-file" value="context://WEB-INF/TestDiskCache.ccf"/>        
</persistent-store>

Where indexedRegion1 and indexedDiskCache are defined with the ccf file.

The TestDiskCache.ccf file must be in your classpath, play with 
this as much as you like - you can use pretty much and of the stores 
defined by JCS in this way.

You will need to alter your cocoon.roles file to use this store:

<role name="org.apache.excalibur.store.Store/PersistentStore"
        shorthand="persistent-store"
        default-class="org.apache.cocoon.components.store.impl.JCSPersistentStore"/>

Obviously the various JARS referenced above need to be available to cocoon both at 
run and compile time :)

Good Luck!!
