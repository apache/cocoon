  What is it?
  -----------

  Apache Cocoon is a web development framework built around the concept
  of separation of concerns (that is: allowing people to do their job
  without having to step on each other toes) and component-oriented web 
  RAD.

  Cocoon implements these concepts around the notion of 'component
  pipelines' modelled after the 'process chain' concept where each 
  worker specializes on a particular operation. This makes it possible
  to use a Lego(tm)-like approach in building web solutions where
  these components can be hooked together into pipelines without
  requiring further programming.

  We like to think at Cocoon as "web glue" for your web application
  development needs. But most important, a glue that can keep 
  concerns separate and allow parallel evolution of the two sides, 
  improving development pace and reducing the chance of conflicts.




  Requirements
  ------------

  Cocoon has been designed to interoperate side-by-side with your J2EE
  existing solutions or give them new functionality without requiring 
  any change in the existing infrastructure.

  Cocoon is implemented both as a Java servlet and a Java command line
  application. The following requirements exist for installing it:

   o  A Java 1.3 or later compatible virtual machine for your operating system.

   o  Server API 2.2 compatible Servlet Engine or J2EE Application Server. 
      [optional for command line operation]
