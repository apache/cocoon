<!--
     This file illustrates the xinclude filter, including 
     parse="text", parse="xml" and a href containing an XPointer
     expression.  The bit included by the xpointer include itself 
     contains an include.

     This document is also processed a second time (as evidenced 
     by the cocoon PIs above) using xslt to produce nice output, 
     which isn't strictly necessary for the example, but it's nice 
     to get something to see in your browser when you hit xinclude_poem.xml.
