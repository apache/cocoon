Generic installation notes for Cocoon
-----------------------------------

1. Please read the Release Notes in the file README which
contains important issues to be aware of, especially if you're
upgrading from an earlier version of Cocoon.

2. If you're installing Cocoon from CVS, you first need to
generate cocoon.jar (and optionally the documentation).
 Read build.xml for building instructions. If you don't know
what CVS is you can skip this step.

3. Read the detailed installation instructions at docs/install.html
or http://xml.apache.org/cocoon/install.html (the latter will be at
least as up-to-date as the docs version, possibly more up-to-date - but
if a new version of Cocoon has been released since you downloaded Cocoon,
the installation instructions on the website may no longer be valid for
the release you downloaded.)

DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT rely completely on the "installation examples for Solaris/Win2000"
because they are not longer totally correct. If in doubt refer to install.html which
is the canonical installation instructions.

4. If you have problems, PLEASE read http://xml.apache.org/cocoon/mail-lists.html
- especially the bit about reading the FAQ first. It will save everyone's time,
including yours, because 99% of installation problems are documented in the FAQ or
mail archives.
