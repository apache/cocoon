This directory shows an example of usage to call Cocoon from a servlet (or
another application).

Please, note that we do not suggest to use Cocoon in such a way unless 
required by limitations imposed by the Servlet API model which doesn't 
include the idea of piping.

The proposed examples show a way to create home-made servlet piping by
creating private wrappers to the given request and response instances.

We were guaranteed the "yet-to-be-designed" Servlet 3.0 model will have
the notion of better servlet componentization, to allow such things to be
developed using the API and internal design patterns, rather than create
home-made ones.
