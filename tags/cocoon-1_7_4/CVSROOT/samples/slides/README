This directory includes everything you need to do the presentation that
Stefano Mazzocchi <stefano@apache.org> gave at ApacheCON 2000. 
These are the exact same slides used during the talk and they were presented 
on Cocoon 1.7.1.

Note that they made extensive use of new web technologies such as CSS and PNG, 
so make sure you have a CSS + PNG capable web browser to access the pages. The
presentation was tested under both MS-IE5 and Mozilla M14.

This doesn't want to be an XML replacer for slide presentation applications, but
a good example of a complex use of XML publishing. Also, the slide DTD is _very_
rought since it was developed just for that purpose.

We have no plans to support or moving further such DTDs or enforce its use, at
the same time, we suggest you to take a look at how things are done and gain
more knowledge on the possibilities of XML publishing.
