<h1 align="center">History of Changes</h1>
<p align="center"><b>Changes are chronologically ordered from top (most recent) to
bottom (least recent)</b></p>
<p><b>Cocoon 1.6-dev </b>- &lt;not yet released, found under CVS&gt;<br>
(<a href="mailto:stefano@apache.org">Stefano Mazzocchi</a>)
<ul>
  <li>Removed all old PI formats from docs and properties file. Thanks to <a href="mailto:Simon@BALR.com">Simon
    McClenahan</a> for the report (SM)</li>
  <li>Added a public method to FormatterFactory to allow more direct formatting.
    Thanks to <a href="mailto:zvia@netmanage.co.il">               Zvi Avraham</a>
    for the suggestion (SM)</li>
  <li>Patched EngineWrapper to allow FileProducer to work when called from
    command line. Thanks to <a href="mailto:hiddinkg@cs.utwente.nl">Gerrit Hiddink</a>
    for the bug report (SM)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Cocoon 1.5 </b>- October 29, 1999<br>
(<a href="mailto:stefano@apache.org">Stefano Mazzocchi</a> [SM], <a href="mailto:balld@webslingerZ.com">Donald
Ball</a>, <a href="mailto:murphyk@umsystem.edu">Kenneth Murphy</a>, <a href="mailto:malimpen@dei.unipd.it">Stefano
Malimpensa</a> [SM2])
<ul>
  <li>Fixed concurrency problem in XML4j parser. Again thanks to Jeffrey Thomas
    Harris for the info (SM)</li>
  <li>Added JRun installation instructions. Thanks to <a href="mailto:sstirlin@gis.net">           Scott Stirling</a>
    for this (SM)</li>
  <li>Added more info on the Cocoon status page. Thanks to <a href="mailto:dlehn@vt.edu">David
    Lehn</a> for the patch. (SM)</li>
  <li>Patched OpenXML that had a bug in the XML publisher that didn't support doctypes imposed from the
    outside. This was breaking the WML formatter. (SM)</li>
  <li>Patched XSL:P to support &lt;xsl:processing-instruction&gt; instead of
    &lt;xsl:pi&gt; which is now deprecated. 
    This makes XSL:P a hybrid between XSLT revisions but it's easier this way than to create two sets
    of examples that work with latest and oldest releases of XSLT. Hopefully XSLT will standardize soon. (SM)</li>
  <li>Fixed XML4J support bug. Thanks to <a href="mailto:harris@columbus.rr.com"> Jeffrey Thomas Harris</a>
    for the patch (SM)</li>
  <li>Added XSL:P Formatters (SM)</li>
  <li>Updated XSL:P to build 19991017 (SM)</li>
  <li>Added parameter visibility to formatters to allow request-dependent
    formatting. Thanks to <a href="mailto:ben@algroup.co.uk">Ben Laurie</a> for
    the suggestion (SM)</li>
  <li>Changed Hashtable in more abstract Dictionary in all interfaces (this will
    be updated to collection classes when JDK 1.2 is available) (SM)</li>
  <li>Updated Fop to version 0.11 (SM)</li>
  <li>Added a work-around for the JServ1.1b2 bug (SM2)</li>
  <li>Updated documentation (SM)</li>
  <li>Added the plan for JavaDOC XML generator and the JavaDOC DTD working draft
    (KM)</li>
  <li>Updated examples, especially the WML example which was based on an
    obsolete WML DTD (SM)</li>
  <li>Added WML formatter (SM)</li>
  <li>Added the ability to &quot;mount&quot; the Cocoon status to a configurable
    URL (SM)</li>
  <li>Added the ability to hide Cocoon status for security reasons (SM)</li>
  <li>Removed the persistent part of the object store since it's not used (SM)</li>
  <li>Fixed DCP problem in loading the initScript.es file as system resource
    (SM)</li>
  <li>Added some better diagnostic hooks. Thanks to <a href="mailto:ben@algroup.co.uk">Ben
    Laurie</a> for the patch (SM)</li>
  <li>Added SQLProcessor (DB)</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug in the EcmaScript language interpreter.(SM2)</li>

<p><b>Cocoon 1.4 </b>- September 13 1999<br>
(<a href="mailto:stefano@apache.org">Stefano Mazzocchi</a>, <a href="mailto:jtauber@jtauber.com">James
Tauber</a>, <a href="mailto:paul_ororke@sparks.com">Paul O'Rorke</a>, <a href="mailto:rrocha@plenix.org">Ricardo
Rocha</a>, <a href="mailto:chris_conway@mail.scp.com">Christopher Conway</a>, <a href="mailto:kvisco@ziplink.net">Keith
Visco</a>, <a href="mailto:hannes@haug.com">Hannes Haug</a>)
<ul>
  <li>Fixed portability issues with JRun and Sun's JSWDK. (HH)</li>
  <li>Added parsed stylesheets caching capabilities to the AbstractXSLTProcessor:
    now if produced files are changed but stylesheets don't, the second are not
    reparsed, improving the system performance since this is a very frequent
    case (SM)&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Reduced the memory footprint of some classes by initializing the
    hashtables to lower values than default (SM)</li>
  <li>Improved the speed of PI searching by looking for first found PI instead
    of scanning the whole file (SM)</li>
  <li>Updated the cocoon processing instructions that drive the reaction: &lt;?<i>cocoon:process?&gt;</i>
    drives the processing reaction, <i>&lt;?cocoon.format?&gt;</i> indicates the
    formatter used to end processing and format the document (SM)</li>
  <li>Removed the processor pipeline and replaced with a reactor-type router
    with PI-based reaction. (SM)</li>
  <li>Moved the example classes in their own package for easier installation and
    testing (SM)&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Modified a number of classes to fit the new Store and Cache subframeworks.
    (SM)</li>
  <li>Added a first implementation of the Cache interface based on dynamic
    evaluation of changeable points. Since each page is created by different
    logic blocks, each one is treated as a <i>changeable point</i> and queried
    for change at request time. This allows the page to be recreated if one of
    the changeable points changes. (SM)</li>
  <li>Added a first implementation of the Store interface based on serialization
    persistency wrapped by an adaptively managed memory buffer. The object
    storage system is used by the Cache system and its ready for long-living
    objects such as compiled pages and such that should survive the JVM
    shutdown. (SM)</li>
  <li>Added support for the Oracle XSL Processor (works only with the Oracle XML
    Parser) (SM)</li>
  <li>Added the Store framework (SM)</li>
  <li>Included FOP Version 0.9.1 that partially supports latest XSL Formatting
    Object specification (19990421) (JT)</li>
  <li>Included XSL:P Version 1.0 Beta (19990823) that supports latest XSLT
    specification (19990421) (KV)</li>
  <li>Introduced the Actor/Director concept to allow cleaner implementation and
    configuration of dynamically loaded objects. (SM)</li>
  <li>Added the WAP example to show how Cocoon can serve the same content to fat
    HTML clients and thin WML clients such as WAP-enabled cellular phones or PDA.
    (SM).</li>
  <li>Removed the need for a properties file in DCP (SM)</li>
  <li>Fixed a minor bug in Configurations. (HH)</li>
  <li>Added the Producer subframework for easier dynamic XML generation (SM)</li>
  <li>Rewrote and cleaned up the formatting section using the Router abstract
    class (SM)</li>
  <li>Rewrote some of the underlying design pattern implementations (SM)</li>
  <li>Fixed bug in SunXMLParser not implementing Status (CC)</li>
  <li>Added support for Oracle XML parser (CC)</li>
  <li>Added Dynamic Content Processor (RR)</li>
  <li>Updated sample configurations to reflect the changes (SM)</li>
  <li>Rewrote the PI parser for more general use in AbstractXSLProcessor (SM)</li>
  <li>Created the EngineWrapper class to extend the Engine class for use on
    non-servlet based applications. (SM)</li>
  <li>Added the possibility to use request parameters to trigger special events
    on the page. Currently <em>debug</em> and <em>cache</em> are supported (SM)</li>
  <li>Added request and cache as parameters for the processor chain as requested
    by more sophisticated processors (SM)</li>
  <li>Changed the cache system interface to match new needs (SM) [note: the
    cache system has not been yet ported]</li>
  <li>Changed the printing architecture. Now, you don't need to specify the type
    of formattation but the publishing system will understand it for you (based
    on processing instructions and the specified document type) (SM)</li>
  <li>Added white paper on the Cocoon 2 architecture for public review (SM)</li>
  <li>Fixed typos, added support for more detailed verbosity and fixed a
    path-parsing bug for win32 systems (PO)</li>
  <li>Added support for James Tauber's FOP to translate XSL:FO-styled documents
    into PDF documents (JT, SM)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Cocoon 1.3.1</b> - May 31 1999<br>
(<a href="mailto:balld@webslingerZ.com">Donald Ball</a>, <a href="mailto:stefano@apache.org">Stefano
Mazzocchi</a>)
<ul>
  <li>Added the first finished working draft of the XSP specification for public
    review (SM)</li>
  <li>Removed the XML and XSL specifications from the distribution (SM)</li>

<ul>
  <li>Included more detailed example of future XSP technology (under <em>examples/xsp</em>).
    Note: the Cocoon 1.x generation will not support XSP and they are currently
    being designed. A very very early access of the working draft is available
    under <em>docs/xsp</em> (SM)</li>

<p><b>Cocoon 1.2</b> - Apr 30 1999<br>
(<a href="mailto:stefano@apache.org">Stefano Mazzocchi</a>, <a href="mailto:balld@webslingerZ.com">Donald
Ball</a>)
<ul>
  <li>Improved documentation and cleaned things around (SM)</li>

  <li>Added the OpenXML printer wrapper class that uses the new X3P API (DB)</li>
  <li>Changed the initialization section to match exceptions thrown on different
    servlet platforms (SM).</li>
  <li>Changed behavior to identity transformation through the DOM processors if
    no PI are found. Thanks to <a href="mailto:george@moberg.com">George T.
    Talbot</a> for pointing it out (SM)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Cocoon 1.1.1</b> - Apr 5 1999<br>
(<a href="mailto:ritter@wt.net">Greg Ritter</a>, <a href="mailto:adrian_durkin@hotmail.com">Adrian
Durkin</a>, <a href="mailto:stefano@apache.org">Stefano Mazzocchi</a>)
<ul>
  <li>Fixed a problem with the getClassloader() method returning null. Now
    Cocoon doesn't always use the internal properties file but adds hardcoded
    default values. This is because in Java 1.1 there is no getSystemClassloader()
    method (SM).</li>
