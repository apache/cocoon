# Remove blocks from your cocoon distribution by uncommenting the 
# corresponding exclude property

# NOTE: don't modify this file directly but make a copy named 
# 'local.blocks.properties' and modify that. The build system will override
# these properties with the ones in the 'local.blocks.properties' file.

# Stable blocks ----------------------------------------------------------------

# stable blocks are those that can be considered ready for production and
# will contain components and API that will remain stable and where
# developers are committed to back compatibility. In short, stuff you can
# depend on.

# Unstable blocks --------------------------------------------------------------

# unstable blocks are currently under development and do not guarantee the
# contracts they expose (API, xml schema, properties, behavior) will remain 
# constant in time. Developers are not committed to back-compatibility just yet.
# This doesn't necessarily mean the blocks implementation is unstable or 
# the code can't be trusted for production, but use with care and watch
# its development as thing might change over time before they are marked
# stable.
