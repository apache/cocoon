# CatalogManager.properties for JUnit test cases
#
# This CatalogManager.properties is loaded by the Resolver that is
# used by the ResolverImpl test case. It is deliberately minimal.
# See the main properties file at webapp/WEB-INF/classes/
#
# The definitions here are usually over-ridden by the settings
# of each test case. An automatically created OASIS catalog will be
# loaded, so there is no need to define one here.
#
# See the Apache Cocoon documentation userdocs/concepts/catalog.html
# and thence the Resolver API and accompanying documentation.
