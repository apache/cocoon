 <s1 title="Overview">
 <p>
  The Cocoon samples are now under <code>src/webapp/samples/</code> and have
  been refactored to be self contained, to have their own sitemaps, and to
  utilise some common resources.
 </p>

 <p>
  However, there are still some old samples that have not yet been moved into
  this new structure. They are at <code>src/webapp/docs/samples/</code> and so
  are not available from the samples page. Please help to bring them back.
 </p>

 <p>
  The main page of the samples is becoming rather cluttered again. The aim
  is to have various samples pages, rather than just one big page.
 </p>

 <p>There are some missing groups of samples, e.g.</p>

<ul>
<li>Welcome => Samples => More Samples => Static Content</li>
<li>Welcome => Samples => More Samples => Server Pages</li>
<li>Welcome => Samples => More Samples => Sources</li>
<li>Welcome => Samples => More Samples => Web Applications</li>
</ul>
 </s1>

 <s1 title="Procedure">

<ul>
<li>Choose your favourite missing sample.</li>
<li>Create a new directory under <code>webapp/samples</code></li>
<li>Follow the example of some other samples,
e.g. <code>poi/</code> or <code>i18n/</code> or <code>misc/</code></li>
<li><code>cp samples/misc/sitemap.xmap samples/yours/sitemap.xmap</code>
and edit it to suit your own matches.
</li>
<li><code>cp samples/misc/samples.xml samples/yours/samples.xml</code>
and edit it to become the front page to your collection of samples.</li>
<li>Move the documents from the old sample at <code>webapp/docs/samples</code></li>
<li>Make links to your new samples from other pages.</li>
<li>Remove the old sample from <code>webapp/docs/samples</code></li>
<li>Ensure that the new sample works as expected.</li>
<li>Send a <link href="../howto/index.html">patch via Bugzilla</link></li>
</ul>
