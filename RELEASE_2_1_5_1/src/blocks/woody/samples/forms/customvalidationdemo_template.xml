  <title>Custom validation sample</title>
  <content>
    <wt:form-template action="#{$continuation/id}.continue" method="POST">

      <p>This form illustrates a number of validation related features.</p>

      <p>First of all, if there are any validation errors attached to widgets
        in the form, you can have them all displayed at one location by using
        the &lt;wi:validation-errors/&gt; tag, as we have done here: (you'll
        only see something after submitting the form).</p>

      <wi:validation-errors/>

      <p>Below, a messages widget is inserted, which allows to display messages
        such as validation errors that are not related to any widget in
        particular: (you'll only see something after submitting the form)</p>

      <wt:widget id="messages"/>

      <br/>
      <br/>

      <wt:widget-label id="number1"/>:
      <wt:widget id="number1"/>

      <br/>

      <wt:widget-label id="number2"/>:
      <wt:widget id="number2"/>

      <br/>
      <br/>

      <input type="submit"/>
    </wt:form-template>
  </content>
