	 <s1 title="Flexible Layout"> 
       <p>You are absolutly free in defining the portal layout. You can combine
         the usual layout elements, like rows and columns, in any order and
         even can nest them.</p>
       <p>By this you can create coplets, like the sample above and below, that span
         more than one column etc.</p>
       <p>Even more complex elements, like tabs are possible.</p>
