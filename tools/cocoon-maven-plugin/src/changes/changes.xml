    <release version="1.0.0-M3" date="2008-??-??" description="unreleased">
      <action dev="reinhard" type="update">
        Upgrade to Spring-Framework 2.5.5
      </action>
    </release>
    <release version="1.0.0-M2" date="2008-04-27" description="released">
      <action dev="reinhard" type="add">
        Introduce the configuration parameter 'webappProfile'. For now two values are supported: 'cocoon-22' (default) and
        'ssf'. 'cocoon-22' creates a Cocoon 2.2 web application, 'ssf' a web application that only makes use of the Servlet-Service
        Framework.
      </action>
      <action dev="reinhard" type="add">
        Introduce the configuration parameter 'customWebappDirectory'. If it is set, the content of the referenced
        directory is added to the prepared web application.
      </action>
      <action dev="reinhard" type="update">
        Rename the goal 'cocoon:rcl' to the less obscure  name 'cocoon:prepare'. This is closer
        to the actual meaning because the purpose of this goal is creating a web application that
        wraps the current block. 'cocooon:rcl' is still supported but deprecated and will be removed
        in future versions of the plugin.
      </action>
      <action dev="reinhard" type="add">
        Add a configuration parameter 'reloadingClassLoaderEnabled' that controlls the usage
        of the reloading classloader. If it is set to false, a URLClassLoader is used.
      </action>
      <action dev="reinhard" type="add">
        Show CREATED messages in console only after the first DELETE or UPDATE message was sent.
        This prevents users from being flooded by CREATED messages during startup.
      </action>
    </release>
    <release version="1.0.0-M1" date="2007-07-02" description="released">

        Initial creation.
