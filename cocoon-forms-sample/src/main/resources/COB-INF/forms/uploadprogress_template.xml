    FormUploadProgress Widget Sample
    
    FormUploadProgress is a Dojo Widget for Cocoon that monitors the progress of uploads from a form.
    
    It works by sending periodical XMLHttp calls to Cocoon in the background, while the files are being uploaded.
    Cocoon responds with JSON data which is used to draw the progress bar and status strings.
    
    You can have multiple file fields.
    The Widget tracks all simultaneous uploads in a single progress bar
    
    Place the Widget inside the form which is doing the upload.
    eg. 
        <div dojoType="ajax:FormUploadProgress">Upload Progress:</div>
 
    It should be possible to use this widget outside the context of a CForm.
 
    There are several parameters that may be optionally configured:
    eg.
        <div dojoType="ajax:FormUploadProgress"
            background="#333"
            color="#ccc"
            ready="upload:progress.ready"
            connecting="upload:progress.connecting" 
            i18n:attr="ready connecting"
        >
            <i18n:text catalogue="upload">progress.title</i18n:text>
        </div>
    
    @background : the CSS colour to use for the progress bar
    @color      : the CSS colour to use for the status text and progress bar border
    @ready      : the String to show on startup
    @connecting : the String to show while connecting
    
    NB. This example assumes the use of an 'upload' catalogue configured in the I18nTransformer

        <para>
            For this example to work, you must enable uploads in your web.xml file.<br/>
            It would also be a good idea to up the limit on file-size a bit, so you can upload larger files to see the effect ....
        </para>
        <para>
            This samples shows uploads in a repeater. Notice how your first click to add an upload row is submitted via XHR, while subsequent clicks are submitted via IframeIO (on supported browsers), as there are now file fields in the form.<br/>
            There is another upload sample with <a href="upload">on-value-changed handler</a> that submits the form as soon as a file is chosen.

                </div>
            </p>
        </ft:form-template>

        <para>Hint: If you are running the client and server on the same machine, you will need to upload a lot to see the effect, or it will upload so fast, the progress bar will not have time to draw.</para>
