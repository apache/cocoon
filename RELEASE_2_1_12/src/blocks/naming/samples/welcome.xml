			<title>Addressbook : Introduction</title>
            <p>Welcome to the Addressbook sample.</p>
            <p>Donated by Ross McDonald and Jeremy Quinn from their presentation at <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/cocoon/GT2006Notes">CocoonGT 2006</a>.</p>
            <p>Please run through the setup section below then give the sample a try <a href="index.html">here</a>.</p>

            <title>Setup</title>
            <p>In order for this sample to work, LDAP needs setting up on this machine.</p>
            <p>You will need to do the following setup in a terminal, using the configuration files in samples/resources in this block.</p>
            
            <p>NB. These instructions are only tested on MacOSX 'Tiger' where OpenLDAP is pre-installed as standard</p>

            <p>Copy the provided OpenLDAP config file :<br/>
                <code>$ cd src/blocks/naming/samples/resources</code><br/>
                <code>$ sudo cp slapd.conf /etc/openldap/slapd.conf</code>
            </p>
            
            <p>Start OpenLDAP :<br/>
                <code>$ sudo /usr/libexec/slapd</code>
            </p>

            <p>Configure the Addressbook directory :<br/>
                <code>$ sudo ldapadd -x -D "dc=ldap,dc=cocoongt,dc=org" -W -f directory.ldif</code>
            </p>

            <p>Add some sample data to the Addressbook :<br/>
                <code>$ sudo ldapadd -x -D "dc=ldap,dc=cocoongt,dc=org" -W -f contact.ldif</code>
            </p>

            <p>When these operations ask for the LDAP password, enter 'secret'</p>
