    | Configuration of a set JMS Connections. 
    | Three types of connections can be configured: 
    | - general <connection>s: created by a call to ConnectionFactory.createConnection()
    | - <topic-connection>s: created by a call to TopicConnectionFactory.createTopicConnection()
    | - <queue-connection>s: created by a call to QeueuConnectionFactory.createQueueConnection()
    | 
    | Each connection must have a unique name. This is the name other components
    | use to retrieve it.
    | 
    | All connection types support the same set of parameters:
    | - javax.naming.*: properties used to create the initial JNDI context.
    |   JNDI parameters must be specified with their literal values here.
    |   For example, javax.naming.Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY is 
    |   equivalent to "java.naming.factory.initial".
    | - connection-factory: the JNDI lookup name of the javax.jms.ConnectionFactory service.
    | - username / password: optional connection credentials
    | - auto-reconnect: when the JMS connection fails when this parameter is set to true
    |   a cron job will be scheduled to attempt to re-establish the connection. Default is false.
    | - auto-reconnect-delay: the amount of time in ms between reconnection attempts. 
    |   Only applies when auto-reconnect is on. Defaults to 1000ms.
