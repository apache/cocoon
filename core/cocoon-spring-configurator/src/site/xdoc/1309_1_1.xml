         <div id="contentBody"><div id="bodyText"><h1 class="docTitle">Running Modes</h1><section name="Running Modes" style="background:none;padding:0;"/><p>The configurator provides the support of <em>running modes</em>. A running
mode defines the environment the application is currently running in. For
example this can be during development, a test setup or production. As you will
see in just some paragraphs, the configurator can use different configurations
and settings depending on the running mode.</p><p>A running mode is just a unique text key, like <tt>dev</tt>, <tt>test</tt>
or <tt>prod</tt>. This key is used to determine the correct configuration at
runtime. Although you can use any text key, it is advisable to use one of the
standard keys (dev, test or prod).</p><p>The running mode can be set in two ways: you can either set it in your
<tt>applicationContext.xml</tt> as a configuration for the <tt>settings
</tt>element:</p><pre>   &lt;!-- Activate Cocoon Spring Configurator --&gt;
   &lt;configurator:settings runningMode="test"/&gt;
</pre><p>Or you can define the running mode by setting the system property
<tt>org.apache.cocoon.mode</tt> on startup of your web application, usually you
do this by specifying <tt>-Dorg.apache.cocoon.mode=test</tt> when starting your
application server. The system property has precedence over the value from the
application context. The default running mode is <tt>prod</tt>.</p></div></div>
