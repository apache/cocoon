      | Entity resolution catalogs
      |
      | The default catalog is distributed at the cocoon-xml-resolver jar file
      | and automatically extracted to a temporary directoy at runtime.
      | The property "catalog" is automatically set to this temporary directory,
      | therefore changing this value in the configuration has no effect!
      |
      | However, it is probably desirable to leave this default catalog config
      | and declare your own local catalogs, which are loaded in addition to
      | the system catalog.
      |
      | There are various ways to do local configuration (see "Entity Catalogs"
      | documentation). You can specify the "localCatalog" property here:
      |
      | localCatalog:
      |   The full filesystem pathname to a single local catalog file.
      |
      |  <property name="localCatalog" value="/usr/local/sgml/mycatalog"/>
      |
      | verbosity:
      | The level of messages for status/debug (messages go to standard output)
      | The following messages are provided ...
      |  0 = none
      |  1 = ? (... not sure yet)
      |  2 = 1+, Loading catalog, Resolved public, Resolved system
      |  3 = 2+, Catalog does not exist, resolvePublic, resolveSystem
      |  10 = 3+, List all catalog entries when loading a catalog
      |    (Cocoon also logs the "Resolved public" messages.)
      |
      |     <property name="verbosity" value="2"/>
      |
      | workingDirectory:
      |   The path to the working directory.
      |
