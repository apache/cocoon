    <release version="1.0.0-RC1" date="2007-??-??" description="unreleased">  
      <action dev="reinhard" type="fix">
        Move all Spring configuration files into the "cocoon-store-impl" namespace.
      </action>       
      <action dev="reinhard" type="fix">
        MRUMemoryStore registers at StoreJanitor only in that case, if StoreJanitor
        is set as dependency. Assuming that in many cases the MRUMemoryStore is
        used for often requested resources like compiled XSLTTemplates or i18n resource bundles,
        it doesn't make sense to remove them as most probably they will be added
        within one of the next requests hiting Cocoon. Find more information
        at http://marc.info/?t=117563247800004&amp;r=1&amp;w=2.
      </action>       
      <action dev="reinhard" type="add">
        Expose all configuration properties that EHCache provides via setter methods.
        Using them, EHDefaultStore can be completly configured in the Spring bean
        definition. This allows setting maxElementsInMemory, memoryStoreEvictionPolicy, 
        overflowToDisk, diskStorePath, eternal, timeToLiveSeconds, timeToIdleSeconds, 
        diskPersistent, diskExpiryThreadIntervalSeconds, registeredEventListeners, 
        bootstrapCacheLoader, maxElementsOnDisk. See the 1.2.4 constructor at 
        http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/javadoc/net/sf/ehcache/Cache.html for
        details.
      </action>        
      <action dev="reinhard" type="fix">
        EHDefaultStore doesn't register at StoreJanitor anymore. The usage of
        StoreJanitor to remove elements from EHDefaultStore was contra-productive,
        because EHCache provides its own invalidation mechanisms which are more
        sophisticated than the removal of random items. Find more information
        at http://marc.info/?t=117563247800004&amp;r=1&amp;w=2.

        Make the maximum number of disk objects configureable. The default value
        is 50000.
