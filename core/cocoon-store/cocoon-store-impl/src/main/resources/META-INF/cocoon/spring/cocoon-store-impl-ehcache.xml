      | Store: generic store. The default implementation is an in-memory store
      | backed by a disk store (based on EHCache). This forms a two-stage
      | cache composed of a fast in-memory MRU front-end and a persistent
      | back-end which stores the less-used objects.
      |
      | Common configuration parameters:
      | maxobjects: Indicates how many objects will be held in the cache.
      |    When the number of maxobjects has been reached. The last object
      |    in the cache will be thrown out.

  The persistent store is only an auxiliary store that shouldn't be

  the Store. If we use JCS, we don't need a persistent store.
