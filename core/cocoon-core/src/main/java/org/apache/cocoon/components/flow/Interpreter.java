/**
 * The interface to the flow scripting languages. This interface is
 * for a component, which implements the appropriate language to be
 * used for describing the flow. A system could have multiple
 * components that implement this interface, each of them for a
 * different scripting language.
 *
 * <p>A flow script defines what is the page flow in an interactive
 * Web application. Usually the flow is defined in a high level
 * programming language which provides the notion of continuations,
 * which allows for the flow of the application to be described as a
 * simple procedural program, without having to think about the
 * application as a finite state machine which changes its internal
 * state on each HTTP request from the client browser.
 *
 * <p>However an implementation may choose to use its own
 * representation of an application, which may include XML
 * representations of finite state machines. Note: this API has no
 * provision for such implementations.
 *
 * <p>The component represented by this interface is called in three
 * situations:
 *
 * <ul>
 *  <li>
 *    <p>From the sitemap, to invoke a top level function defined in a
 *    * given implementation language of the flow. This is done from
 *    the * sitemap using the construction:
 *
 *    <pre>
 *      &lt;map:call function="..." language="..."/&gt;
 *    </pre>
 *
 *    <p>The <code>language</code> attribute can be ignored if the *
 *    default language is used.
 *
 *  <li>
 *    <p>From the sitemap, to continue a previously started
 *    computation. A previously started computation is saved in the
 *    form of a continuation inside the flow implementation language.
 *
 *    <p>This case is similar with the above one, but the function
 *    invoked has a special name, specific to each language
 *    implementation. See the language implementation for more
 *    information on the function name and the arguments it receives.
 *
 *  <li>
 *    <p>From a program in the flow layer. This is done to invoke a
 *    pipeline defined in the sitemap, to generate the response of the
 *    request.
 * </ul>
