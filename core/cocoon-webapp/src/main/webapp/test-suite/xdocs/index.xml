      <p>
          Apache Cocoon is a web development framework built around the concepts 
          of component-based web development and separation of concerns, ensuring 
          that people can interact and collaborate on a project without stepping 
          on each other toes.

      <p>
          The purpose of these pages is to provide a webapp to be used in testing
          Cocoon itself. These pages are not intended to be read by humans - rather
          to be read by automated tests that are a part of Cocoon itself.
