    | This is the 'heart' of Cocoon. The sitemap maps URI space to
    | resources. It consists basicaly of two parts: components and
    | pipelines. Pipelines are made out of components. There is such a
    | vast number of components available that it would be impossible to
    | describe them here, please refer to the accompanying
    | documentation. For specific components, have a look also at the
    | javadocs for them. Most pipelines are present to demonstrate some
    | feature or technique, often they are explained in more detail in
    | the accompanying documentation. The sitemaps which come with each
    | sample and each block will help to explain.

<!-- =========================== Components ================================ -->

 <map:components>

   <!--+
       | All needed components are inherited from the parent container
       | configured in WEB-INF/cocoon.xconf
       +-->

 </map:components>


<!-- =========================== Views =================================== -->

  <!--+
      | Views provide different, well, views to resources. Views are
      | orthogonal to pipelines. Please refer to the docs.
      |
      | It would be wise to disable any unneeded views in a
      | production environment in order to avoid exposing data
      | that you may not necessarily wish to.
      +-->

    <map:view from-label="content" name="content">
      <map:serialize type="xml"/>

<!-- =========================== Resources ================================= -->

  <!--+
      | Resources are pipeline fragments that may be used from different
      | pipeline fragments. For our needs, they behave exactly like
      | pipelines, only that they are not accessible from outside.
      | Hence I will explain what's inside below for pipelines.
      +-->
 <map:resources>
 </map:resources>


<!-- ========================== Action sets ================================ -->

 <!--+
     | Action sets group actions together. If some actions are often used
     | together in pipeline fragments, it's easier to group them and refer
     | to the group. For more info, please see the docs.
     +-->
  <map:action-sets>
  </map:action-sets>


<!-- =========================== Pipelines ================================= -->

 <!--+
     | Pipelines. The beef. Pipelines specify how the processing of your
     | content is done. Usually, a pipeline consists of several fragments
     | that specify the generation, transformation, and serialization of
     | SAX events.
     |
     | Processing is done in two steps:
     |
     | 1) The top level elements are executed in order of appearance until
     |    one signals success. These top level elements are usually
     |    matchers.
     |
     |    Other components are called depth-first to determine what
     |    fragments make up the processing pipeline. When a component
     |    fails, no nested components are called but the next component on
     |    the same level.
     |
     | 2) Once it is determined which generator, which transformers and
     |    wich serializer is used, these components are executed. During
     |    this, the pipeline may not be changed.
     |
     | You may have as many pipelines in your sitemap as you like.

           |   ...
           | You can access them by {global:*name*}, e.g. {global:skin}.
           | These values are inherited into sub-sitemaps and can
           | be extended there.

          | Start generating SAX events inside the pipeline. In this case,
          | since no "type" attribute is specified, the default generator
          | is used and this is a regular XML parser that reads the
          | given file from the URL included in the "src" attribute and
          | sends the events produced by the parser down the pipeline to
          | be processed by the next stage.

      <!--+
          | This transformer gets the input SAX events and transforms them
          | using the default transformer (the XSLT transformer) thus
          | applying the XSLT stylesheet indicated in the "src" attribute
          | and sending the output down the pipeline to be processed by the

          | The serializer concludes the SAX events journey into the pipeline
          | since it serializes the events it receives into a representation
          | depending on the serializer type. Here we choose the "XHMTL"
          | serializer, which will produce an XHTML representation of the
          | SAX stream.

    <!--+
        | The default matching is also capable of matching more than a
        | single request by the use of 'wildcards'. There are two kinds of
        | wildcards:
        |
        |  "*" means "anything that does not contain a path separator"
        |  "**" means "anything including path separators"
        |
        | The tokens matched by the wildcards are passed over as sitemap
        | variables. Those variables can be accessed using the '{...}' syntax
        | inside the attributes. The URI-matching tokens are associated to
        | numbered variables, as shown in the following match that processes all
        | the GIF images that are located in the 'images/' URL space but
        | not in any deeper levels. Note how requesting "images/logo.gif"
        | triggers the matcher to create the token {1} = 'logo' which is later
        | expanded into the src="" attribute of the reader, indicating
        | what file it has to read.

        | them to the same system resources is your concern, not Cocoon's.
        | Note that some stupid browsers (IE, for example) believe the opposite
