 <s1 title="Cocoon Links Overview">
  <p>
   There is a wealth of information about Cocoon from external sources.
   This is a collection of links to some of them.
  </p>

  <p>
   Come back often ... this collection is being updated regularly via the
   <code>cocoon-users</code> mailing list.
  </p>

  <p>The actual link category pages are available from the side-panel.
  </p>

  <s1 title="How to get listed">
   <p>
    Find out in which section of the Cocoon Links your site/page fits, 
    go there and use the email link at the bottom of the corresponding section.
    Enter a meaningful title after the required words in the subject,
    provide a short summary of your site/page, and do not forget to tell us
    the URL.
    You could also follow the <link href="../contrib.html">Contributing</link>
