!!! Introduction

This is a little example how easy it is to write a wiki engine 
using the Chaperon parser and Apache Cocoon.

Here are some example sites:
* [Rule of the wiki|rules]
* [Test document|selftest]
* [Broken page|broken]
* [New page|new]

You can edit the page with the little "edit" under the Cocoon logo.
