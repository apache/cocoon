   <p>The second argument to <link href="api.html#sendPage"><code>cocoon.sendPage()</code></link> and
    <link href="api.html#sendPageAndWait"><code>cocoon.sendPageAndWait()</code></link> is a context object,
    which can be a simple dictionary with values that need to be displayed by the page. More
    generally any Java or JavaScript object can be passed here, as long as the necessary <em>get</em>
    methods for the important values are provided.</p>
   <p>The page specified by the URL is processed by the sitemap, using the normal sitemap rules.</p>
   <p>Several Cocoon generators are provided that allow you to access the context object and inject
    its values into a pipeline. Currently, these are the
    <link href="jxtemplate.html">JXTemplate Generator</link>,
    <link href="jpath.html">JPath XSP Logic Sheet</link> and
    <link href="velocity.html">Velocity Generator</link>.
