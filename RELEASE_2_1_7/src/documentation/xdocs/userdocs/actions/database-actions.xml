  <s1 title="Introduction">
    <p>
    Two different sets of actions exist, that deal with (object) relational
    database access through JDBC. The original database actions provide a
    relatively simple interface to store, modify, delete and retrieve data.
    They are oriented towards usage of request parameters for input and
    request attributes together with sitemap variables for output and do
    not support auto increment column types. In addition, the description of
    the database structure is split over several files since these actions
    attempt to use all tables in a provided description.
    </p>
    <p>
    The modular database actions provide similar functionality. In contrast
    to the original actions they allow to store the database meta data in a
    single file and to switch input and output flexible through the use of
    modules. Even for auto increment columns specific modules exist that
    cover a wide range of database management systems.
    </p>
      <p>
        For an overview of column types supported by the modular database
        actions, see javadocs for JDBCTypeConversions. The types supported by
        the original actions are documented in AbstractDatabaseAction.
      </p>
  </s1>

  <s1 title="Original Database Actions">
    <p>
    The original database actions have evolved quite a bit and at different
    speeds. The add action is certainly the most complete one, providing
    support for multiple tables and rows. However, the interface has become
    a bit inconsistent.
    </p>
    <p>
    If an error occurs, the original database actions will throw an
    exception.
    </p>
    <s2 title="Describing the Structure of your DB - descriptor.xml">
    <p>
      The key to database actions is a file that describes database meta
      data in XML. The original actions will ignore all but the first table
      and act only on one row. Only the add action will try to access all
      tables that are contained in this description. As a consequence, each
      HTML form needs to have a corresponding descriptor file if different
      tables are affected.
    </p>
    <p>
      The file name has no meaning and does not need to be
      <code>descriptor.xml</code> - it can even be a Cocoon pipeline. The
      name of the root element in a descriptor file is ignored. Only
      <code>table</code> elements nested on first level inside the root
      element are parsed by the actions. All unknown elements or attributes
      are ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
      For each table a <code>table</code> element needs to be present. 
    </p>

    </source>
    <p>
      Describes a single table named "employee". In addition a database
      connection is specified. See <link
      href="../../developing/datasources.html">here</link> for more
      information on database connections. 
    </p>

    <s3 title="Key Columns">
      <p>
      Tables may or may not have key columns. A key column is a column
      that is part of the primary key. Actually, candidate keys should do
      as well.
      </p>
      <p>
      All key columns are contained in a <code>keys</code> child element
      of the <code>table</code> element. Each column has a
      <code>key</code> element to define its properties. The
      <code>dbcol</code> attribute holds the column name,
      <code>type</code> is the JDBC type name for this column (have a
      look at AbstactDatabaseAction source for valid type names),
      <code>param</code> specifies the name of the request parameter to
      use, and <code>mode</code> sets how the value for this column is
      obtained on adding a row.
      </p>
      <p>
      Through the mode attribute the behaviour of the add action can be
      changed.
      </p> 
      <p>
      Default mode is "automatic" and to let the database create the key
      value by setting this value to <code>null</code>. The created value
      can not be read back from the database and will not be available as
      request attribute or sitemap variable.
      </p>
      <p>
      A mode of "manual" will query the database for the maximum current
      value, add 1 to it and use that for a value.
      </p>
      <p>
      A mode of "form" will use the corresponding request parameter.
      </p>
      <p>
      A mode of "request-attribute" will use the corresponding request
      attribute. The name specified in the <code>param</code> attribute
      will be automatically prefixed with the class name.
      </p>
      <p>
      Key values will be propagated to sitemap variables and - prefixed
      with the class name - request attributes.
      </p>
    </s3>
    <s3 title="Other Columns">
      <p>
      All other columns are contained in a <code>values</code> child
      element of the <code>table</code> element. Each column has a
      <code>value</code> element to define its properties. Properties are
      similar to those for key columns. A <code>mode</code> attribute
      does not exist for value columns. Instead, request parameters and
      request attributes are tried in this order for the specified
      parameter. 
      </p>
      <p>
      Request attribute names are <em>not</em> prefixed with the class
      name. Thus, to insert the value of a key column of the previous row
      or previous table into a value column, it needs to be named
      <code>org.apache.cocoon.acting.AbstractDatabaseAction:key:table:dbcol</code>. 
      </p>
      <p>
      Value columns are propagated to request attributes with class name
      prefix. They are not available for the sitemap.
      </p>
    </s3>
    </s2>
  </s1>
  <s1 title="Modular Database Actions">
    <p>
    The modular database actions were mainly created to make auto increment
    columns available, handle input and output flexibly, and have a
    consistent interface. A successful action will return the number of
    rows affected in a sitemap parameter named <code>row-count</code>. The
    added features required to change the descriptor file format in
    incompatible ways.
    </p>
    <p>
    It can be configured if an exception will be thrown when an error
    occurs.
    </p>
    <s2 title="Describing the Structure of your DB - descriptor.xml">
    <p>
      Like the original actions, the modular actions need meta data in an
      XML file. However, that file may contain any number of tables, not
      just the ones needed for a single request. The tables actually used
      are referenced through a <code>table-set</code>. Unknown elements and
      attributes are ignored. This way a descriptor file can be shared with
      other actions like the form validator.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the flexible input and output handling, the modular database
      actions rely on <link href="../concepts/modules.html">modules</link>.
      Have a look at those before proceeding.
    </p>
        <p>
          The following is a snippet from a descriptor file. 
        </p>
    <source>
<![CDATA[
<root>
   <connection>personnel</connection>
   <table name="user" alias="user">
      <keys>
         <key name="uid" type="int" autoincrement="true">
            <mode name="auto"  type="autoincr"/>
         </key>
      </keys>
      <values>
         <value name="name"      type="string"></value>
         <value name="firstname" type="string"></value>
         <value name="uname"     type="string"></value>
      </values>   
   </table>
]]>
        </source>
        <p>
          The <code>table</code> element has an additional attribute
          <code>alias</code> which is an alternative name to reference
          the table from a table set. The descriptor file is searched
          top down for tables whose <code>name</code> or
          <code>alias</code> match. The <code>alias</code>n attribute
          is useful if a complex join expression is used as table
          name. In such a case modifications like update, insert,
          delete will likely fail.
        </p>
    <p>
      Another application of aliases if different numbers of columns should
      be affected by an operation. or if a table contains several candidate
      keys that are used alternatively. This way, different views to a
      table can be created.
    </p>
    <s3 title="Key Columns">
      <p>
      The descriptor file resembles the one for the original actions. One
      major difference is the absence of <code>dbcol</code> and
      <code>param</code> attributes. Instead there is a <code>name</code>
      attribute which corresponds to the <code>dbcol</code> attribute and
      specifies the database column name.
      </p>
      <p>
      If a column is an auto increment column, the similar named attribute
      indicates this. Auto increment columns will be handled differently
      on insert operations.
      </p>
      <p>
      Instead of specifying a parameter name, the actions support to use
      different input modules for each operation through the nested
      <code>mode</code> elements. This is described in more detail below.
      </p>
      <p>
      Note here though, that not every column needs a <code>mode</code>
      element: The actions default to the module defined as
      <code>request</code> which is in a default installation to obtain
      the values from request parameters. The name of the parameter
      defaults to table name dot column name.
      </p>
    </s3>
    <s3 title="Other Columns">
      <p>
            Apart from the fact that the auto increment columns are only
      supported for key columns, everything said above applies to value
      columns as well.
          </p>
    </s3>
    <s3 title="Operation Mode Types">
      <p>
      Basically, two different mode types exist:
      <code>autoincrement</code> which is used whenever data shall be
      inserted into a table and this particular key column has the
      auto increment attribute set and <code>others</code> for all other
      requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, a table-set can specify different mode types to use
      instead of the predefined type names. Through this, and the fact
      that every mode can specify a different input module, it is easy to
      use different input modules for different tasks and forms.
          </p>
          <p>
            One special mode type name exists that matches all requested ones:
      <code>all</code> This makes it easier to configure only some
      columns differently for each table-set.
          </p>
    </s3>
    <s3 title="How to obtain Values">
      <p>
      As said above, these actions default to reading from request
      parameters with a default parameter name. By specifying
      <code>mode</code> elements, this can be overridden. Any component
      that implements the <code>InputModule</code> interface can be used
      to obtain values. How to make such modules known to Apache Cocoon
      is described  <link href="../concepts/modules.html">elsewhere</link>. 
      </p>
      <p>
      Beside using different input modules, their parameters can be set
      in place, for example to override parameter names, configure a
      random generator or a message digest algorithm.
      </p>

      <source>
<![CDATA[
   <table name="user_groups">
      <keys>
         <key name="uid" type="int">
            <mode name="request" type="request">
               <parameter>user_groups.uid</parameter>
            </mode>
            <mode name="attribute" type="attrib">
               <parameter>org.apache.cocoon.components.modules.output.OutputModule:user.uid[0]</parameter>
            </mode>
         </key>
         <key name="gid" type="int" set="master">
            <mode name="request" type="all">
               <parameter>user_groups.gid</parameter>
            </mode>
         </key>
      </keys>
   </table>
]]>
      </source>
      <p>
      The above example shows just that: the <code>parameter</code>
      element is not read by the database action itself but the
      complete <code>mode</code> configuration object is passed to the
      input module. Both the request attribute and the request parameter
      input modules understand this parameter attribute which takes
      precedence over the default one.
      </p>
      <p>
      Another feature when obtaining values is tied to the
      <code>type</code> attribute: Different modes can be used in
      different situations. The basic setup uses two different mode
      types: <code>autoincrement</code> when inserting in key columns
      that have an indicator that they are indeed auto increment columns
      and <code>others</code> for insert operations on all other columns
      and all other operations on all columns.
      </p>
      <p>
      Table-sets can override the default names for these two mode type
      name categories with arbitrary names except the special name
      <code>all</code>. A mode that carries the type name "all" is used
      with all requested type names. Lookup obeys first match principle
      so that all modes are tested from top to bottom and the first that
      matches is used.
      </p>
    </s3>
    <s3 title="How to store Values e.g. in your Session">
      <p>
      All modular database action can be configured to use any component
      that implements the <code>OutputModule</code> interface to store
      values. The output module is chosen on declaring the action in the
      sitemap or dynamically with a sitemap parameter. If no output
      module is specified, the default it to use the request attribute
      module.
      </p>
      <p>
      The interface does not allow to pass configuration information to
      the output module. This has to be done when the module is declared
      e.g. in cocoon.xconf.
      </p>
    </s3>
    <s3 title="Inserting Multiple Rows - Sets">
      <p>
      Once common task is to work on more than one row. If the rows are
      in different tables, this is catered for by table-sets. Operating
      on multiple rows of one table requires to mark columns that should
      vary and among those one, that determines the number of rows to
      work on.
      </p>
      <p>
      This is done with sets. All columns that cary a <code>set</code>
      attribute can vary, those, that don't, are kept fixed during the
      operation. The column that is used to determine the number of rows
      is required to have a value of <code>master</code> while all others
      need to have a value of <code>slave</code> for the set
      attribute. There may be only one master in a set.
      </p>
      <p>
      Sets can be tagged either on column or on mode level but not both
      for a single column.
      </p>
    </s3>
    <s3 title="Select Your Tables - Table-Sets">
      <p>
      Tables that should be used during an operation can be grouped
      together with a table-set. A table-set references tables by their
      name or their alias.
      </p>
      <p>
      In addition, a table-set can override the mode type names for the
      two categories "autoincrement" and "others".
      </p>
      <p>
      Operations spanning multiple tables in a table-set are done in a
      single transaction. Thus, if one fails, the other is rolled back.
