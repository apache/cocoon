 
 What is left to do?
 -------------------

Tons of stuff, but here is a list of the things that I think are most important 
at the moment:

 - allow the ability to reload the java flow classes using for example the
   CompilingClassLoader.
 
 - some patches need to be applied to the jakarta-bcel project, see
   http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=27646
   http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=27854
   http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=27855
   We got already a "go" of the author, but he wasn't able to commit these
   patches at the moment.

 - The suspend of continuations seems not to work properly in "finally"
   blocks.
 
 - The OJB example throw an exception if the ID is already assigned.

 - The continuation is not available in the constructor, so there
   is no ContinuationContext availble. This makes lookups of components
   impossible. The move of the continuation context into an
   independent ThreadLocal variable might be an option.

 - The classloader seems to have problems with inner classes, because the
   the inner classes is not transformed by the ContinuationClassLoader, which
   caused a LinkageError.
   Temporary solution is to implement Continuable for the inner class.
