      | OutputModules are companion modules for InputModules.
      |
      | The same principles apply here, only that OutputModules allow
      | writing data to places. Apparently, there are a lot less
      | places to write to than to read data from, thus there are only
      | a few OutputModules coming with Apache Cocoon.
      |
      | One special feature of OutputModules is, that they expose some
      | limited transactional behaviour. Hence it does not suffice to
      | write a value, but it is required to confirm this at the
      | end. Until then, the value could not be read from the
      | corresponding InputModule. This behaviour is not enfored but
      | it should be expected. Omitting a commit or rollback is an
      | error.
      |
      | OutputModules are currently used by flow, a number of actions
      | and transformers.
