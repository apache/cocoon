# This file contains the default settings for Cocoon.
# You should NOT change this file directly. Create your own properties
# file and put it in the sub directories for the mode you are running
# Cocoon in.

# This parameter points to the main configuration file for Cocoon.
org.apache.cocoon.configuration=/WEB-INF/cocoon/cocoon.xconf

# Delay between reload checks for the configuration in ms.
# The check is only performed if reloading is turned on!
org.apache.cocoon.reload-delay=1000

# Allow reinstantiating (reloading) of the cocoon instance. If this is
# set to "yes" or "true", a new cocoon instance can be created using
# the request parameter "cocoon-reload". It also enables that Cocoon is
# reloaded when cocoon.xconf changes. Default is no for security reasons.
org.apache.cocoon.reloading=no

# Turn on reloading for specific parts:
#org.apache.cocoon.reloading.sitemap=yes
#org.apache.cocoon.reload-delay.sitemap=5000
#org.apache.cocoon.reloading.config=yes
#org.apache.cocoon.reloading.flow=yes

# This parameter indicates the log4j configuration file.
org.apache.cocoon.logging.configuration=WEB-INF/cocoon/log4j.xconf

# This parameter indicates the category id of the logger
# configuration used by the environment Cocoon runs in (CLI, Servlet etc.).
org.apache.cocoon.logging.category.environment=access

# This parameter indicates the category id of the logger from the
# logging system for the Cocoon engine.
# This logger is used for all components described in the cocoon.xconf
# and sitemap.xmap file not having specified a logger with the
# logger="..." attribute in the component configuration file.
org.apache.cocoon.logging.category.cocoon=core

# This parameter indicates the log level to use throughout startup of the
# system. As soon as the logging system is set up, the setting of the
# logging system is used instead!
# Available levels are:
#       DEBUG:        prints all level of log messages.
#       INFO:         prints all level of log messages except DEBUG ones.
#       WARN:         prints all level of log messages except DEBUG and INFO ones.
#       ERROR:        prints all level of log messages except DEBUG, INFO and WARN ones.
#       FATAL_ERROR:  prints only log messages of this level

# Causes all files in multipart requests to be processed.
# Default is true but the maximum allowed size is kept small for security reasons.
# Unsupported values will be interpreted as false.
org.apache.cocoon.uploads.enable=true

# This parameter allows to specify where Cocoon should put uploaded files.
# The path specified can be either absolute or relative to the context
# path of the servlet. On windows platform, absolute directory must start
# with volume: C:\Path\To\Upload\Directory
#
# The default directory is "upload-dir" in the work-directory
#org.apache.cocoon.uploads.directory=WEB-INF/work/upload-dir

# Causes all files in multipart requests to be saved to upload-dir.
# Default is true for security reasons.
# Unsupported values will be interpreted as false.
org.apache.cocoon.uploads.autosave=true

# Specify handling of name conflicts when saving uploaded files to disk.
# Acceptable values are deny, allow, rename (default). Files are renamed
# x_filename where x is an integer value incremented to make the new
# filename unique.
org.apache.cocoon.uploads.overwrite=rename

# Specify maximum allowed size of the upload. Defaults to 10 Mb.
# Set here to a very low 100 kb to allow samples to run.
org.apache.cocoon.uploads.maxsize=102400

# This parameter allows to specify where Cocoon should create its page
# and other objects cache. The path specified can be either absolute or
# relative to the context path of the servlet. On windows platform,
# absolute directory must start with volume: C:\Path\To\Cache\Directory
#
# The default directory is "cache-dir" in the work-directory.
#org.apache.cocoon.cache.directory=WEB-INF/work/cache-dir

# This parameter allows to specify where Cocoon should put it's
# working files. The path specified is either absolute or relative
# to the context path of the Cocoon servlet. On windows platform,
# absolute directory must start with volume: C:\Path\To\Work\Directory
#
# The default directory is "cocoon-files" directory in the servlet
# context's temp directory (context property javax.servlet.context.tempdir).
#org.apache.cocoon.work.directory=WEB-INF/work

# This parameter is used to list classes that should be loaded at
# initialization time of the servlet. For example, JDBC Drivers used need to
# be named here. Additional entries may be inserted here during build
# depending on your build properties.
#
# For parent ServiceManager sample:
#org.apache.cocoon.classloader.load.classes.parentcm=org.apache.cocoon.samples.parentcm.Configurator
#
# For IBM WebSphere:
#org.apache.cocoon.classloader.load.classes.websphere=com.ibm.servlet.classloader.Handler

# If you set this parameter to 'true' or 'yes', Cocoon will add processing
# time to the end of each response. Value 'hide' adds processing time as an
# HTML comment. By default, processing time is not added (corresponds to
# value 'no').
# NOTE: If you use this feature, Cocoon might generated a wrong content
# length header in the response. This is due to the internal processing
# of Readers and the Caching. So, this might be the reason if you get
# a warning about a wrong content length.
#  See http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=17370.
#org.apache.cocoon.showtime=true
#org.apache.cocoon.hideshowtime=true

# Whether or not the X-Cocoon-Version response header will be included.
# This is true by default, but there may be some circumstances when it
# is not desired (e.g. "information hiding" for added security, or if
# using jsp:include with Cocoon-generated pages produces a "response is
# already committed" error).
org.apache.cocoon.showcocoonversion=true

# If true or not set, this class will try to catch and handle all Cocoon
# exceptions. If false, it will rethrow them to the servlet container.

# Set form encoding. This will be the character set used to decode request
# parameters. If not set the ISO-8859-1 encoding will be assumed.
