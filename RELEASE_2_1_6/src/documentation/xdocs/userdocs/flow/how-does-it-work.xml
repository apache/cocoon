    <s1 title="Cocoon and continuations">
	<p>With continuations in the language, you can essentially
	store the continuation of <code>sendPageAndWait()</code> (think of all
	the stack trace, and the program counter), put it in a global
	hash table associated with an id. The id is then encoded in
	the <code>response.xml</code> page as an URL. When the user
	clicks on that URL, on the server side the associated
	continuation is resumed. Resuming the processing happens as if
	nothing was stopped, you get all the stack trace back, and all
	the local variables.</p>

	<p>So instead of using beans to store things in session, you
	use normal variables in a program. Since each user has its own
	version of the program, all the local variables in the program
	are separate between users.</p>

	<p>With this approach clicking the <em>Back</em> button in the
	browser is no longer a hassle to deal with for you as a
	server-side programmer. They will simply refer to past
	continuations objects, which have their own state of the local
	variables.</p>

	<p>Since continuations are objects, you can also store them in
	a database, for really long-lived session, just like you do
	with session beans.</p>
