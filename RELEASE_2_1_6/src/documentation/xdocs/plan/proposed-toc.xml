 <s1 title="Proposed TOC for Consolidated Cocoon Guide">

  <p>
Here is a proposed table of contents for a new Cocoon Guide. This means refactoring existing core documents of all three current guides: CTWIG, user, and developer. It also means plugging many content holes. Please post your comments about it to the 
<link href="http://cocoon.apache.org/community/mail-lists.html"><code>cocoon-docs</code></link> mailing list.
Even better, help us turn this proposed outline into a real guide by contributing some new docs!
  </p>
