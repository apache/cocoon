    <s1 title="The usual Cocoon Developer profile">
      <p>As a Cocoon developer (someone who develops components for Cocoon), you
         need of course everything you have to know as a Cocoon user. In addition
         you should have a basic understanding of the following technologies.
         Again, this knowledge is not specific to Cocoon; it can be used for
         building web applications with different frameworks as well.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Java Language and Application Frameworks</li>
        <li>Java Servlets</li>
        <li><link href="avalon.html">Avalon Component Framework</link></li>
      </ul>

 <s1 title="Overview">

  <p>Here will soon appear an overview of the developer perspective.
  </p>
  <p>If you are interested in developing real-world web-applications requiring
    form handling, authentication or even developing your own portal, have a 
    look at the <link href="webapps/index.html">web application documentation</link>.</p>
  <p>The actual developer documentation is available from the side-panel.
