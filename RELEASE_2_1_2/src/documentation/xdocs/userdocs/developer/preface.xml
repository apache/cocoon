    <s1 title="The usual Cocoon Developer profile">
      <p>As a Cocoon developer (someone who develops components for Cocoon), you
         need of course everything you have to know as a Cocoon user. In addition
         you should have a basic understanding of the following technologies.
         Again, this knowledge is not specific to Cocoon; it can be used for
         building web applications with different frameworks as well.
