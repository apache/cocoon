 What is this?
 -------------
 
Linotypes were machines that first allowed a single individual to mass-produce content without sacrificing typesetting elegance and text readability. Blogs turned the web into writeable media without sacrificing the ability to remain hypertextual. This is simply an attempt to combine the two concepts together.

 Requirements
 ------------

On the server side, Linotype just depends on Cocoon and saves its edited content on disk, nothing else.

To edit content with Linotype, a browser that supports the Mozilla Midas API is required. For now this means
Mozilla 1.3 or greater. Note that Midas is *NOT* part of standard Gecko, so Camino and other Gecko-based browser
won't do it.

Thanks for your interest in Linotype.
