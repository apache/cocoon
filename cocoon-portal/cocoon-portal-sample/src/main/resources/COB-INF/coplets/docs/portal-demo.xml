	 <section title="The Apache Cocoon Portal"> 
		<p>This is a demo of the Cocoon Portal Engine.</p>
        <p>The Cocoon portal page you currently view displays some so called
          <em>Coplets</em> (= Cocoon Portlets). Each coplet displays
          a different content.</p> 
        <p>The different tabs display/demonstrate different aspects of the portal.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The TabDemo1 shows a tab inside a tab, which is useful for structuring content.</li>
          <li>The TabDemo2 shows the same content as TabDemo2 but with just a different stylesheet for the tab.</li>
          <li>The Gallery tab shows some more coplets.</li>
          <li>The JSR-168 tab demonstrates the integration of Portlets (read more below).</li>
          <li>The WSRP tab demonstrates the integration of WSRP portlets (read more below).</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>THIS IS A SAMPLE PORTAL!</strong></p>
        <p>It demonstrates several features of 
          the portal engine, so it's not optimized for production. Make sure 
          that if you use the portal for your own projects that you
          remove all unused stuff from the configuration! Every configured
          feature might have an impact on the performance.
        </p>
        <p>For more information <fork href="http://cocoon.apache.org">visit the Cocoon Homepage</fork>.</p>
     </section> 
     <section title="The JSR 168">
        <p>The Cocoon portal supports portlets conforming to the JSR 168. The JSR 168 tab contains 
           a sample using the testsuite from the <fork href="http://portals.apache.org/pluto">Pluto project</fork>.</p>
        <p>
          If you want to use JSR 168 portlets, you have to follow some installation instructions
          as the current build system of Cocoon is not capable of doing so. (An easy installation
          procedure will follow as soon as possible).
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Install Cocoon in different servlet engine than Jetty, for example Tomcat.</li>
          <li>Enable cross context access for Cocoon (see Tomcat configuration
             documentation for more infos).</li>
           <li>Move (not copy!) the pluto-*.jar, the portlet-api-*.jar and the portals-bridges-*.jar
             from the Cocoon WEB-INF/lib directory to the TOMCAT_HOME/shared/lib directory.</li>
           <li>Copy the cocoon-portal-*.jar from the WEB-INF/lib/directory to the TOMCAT_HOME/shared/lib
             directory.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The included samples only work if you follow these additional installation instructions:</p>
        <ul>
         <li>Get the Pluto project and build the testsuite.war.</li>
         <li>Copy the testsuite.war into the cocoon/samples/blocks/portal-sample/conf/deploy directory.</li>
         <li>Start Tomcat, go to the portal sample page, give Cocoon some seconds to deploy the portlets and
           then log into the portal.</li>
        </ul>
     </section>
     <section title="WSRP">
        <p>The Cocoon portal supports portlets conforming to the WSRP. The WSRP tab contains 
           a sample using the testsuite from the <fork href="http://ws.apache.org/wsrp4j">WSRP4J project</fork>.</p>
        <p>These samples only work if you follow these installation instructions:</p>
        <ul>
         <li>Get the WSRP4J project and install it into Tomcat (Test WSRP using the SwingConsumer now).</li>
         <li>Start up Tomcat (with the WSRP producer) and Cocoon (using Jetty) and run the Cocoon portal demo. You should see the WSRP portlets now.</li>
        </ul>
