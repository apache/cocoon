<announcement site="http://cocoon.apache.org">
  <project>Apache Cocoon @version@</project>
  <abstract>
   The Apache Cocoon Community is proud to announce the new release
   of Apache Cocoon.
  </abstract>
  <body>
  
<p>
  Apache Cocoon is a web development framework built around the concept
  of separation of concerns (that is: allowing people to do their job
  without having to step on each other toes) and component-oriented web 
  RAD.
</p>

<p>
  Cocoon implements these concepts around the notion of 'component
  pipelines' modelled after the 'process chain' concept where each 
  worker specializes on a particular operation. This makes it possible
  to use a Lego(tm)-like approach in building web solutions where
  these components can be hooked together into pipelines without
  requiring further programming.
</p>

<p>
  We like to think at Cocoon as "web glue" for your web application
  development needs. But most important, a glue that can keep 
  concerns separate and allow parallel evolution of the two sides, 
  improving development pace and reducing the chance of conflicts.
