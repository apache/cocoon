*****************************  W A R N I N G  **********************************

  Some user accessible points in this software package should be considered
  "alpha". This means that the developer team is not investing _any_ effort
  to provide backward compatibility between alpha releases for these parts.
  This software will continue to be released as "alpha" until its code, 
  schemas, and APIs are considered stable.
  
  The Cocoon development team understands the importance of reliable
  software as well protecting user investments through the creation of
  a solid development platform that doesn't change. On the other hand, 
  the Cocoon project is a pioneer in many fields. Many of the technologies 
  it uses in this version are at a "working draft" phase only. Thus,
  reliability cannot be guaranteed before the software achieves its "final"
  status.
  
  Until then, no effort will be provided to guarantee backward compatibility
  for any parts considered alpha.

  Stable versions such as Cocoon-2.1 should be used in the meantime.

  You have been warned.
