Cocoon standalone-demo
----------------------
After building this version with "build standalone-demo" from the main Cocoon distribution
directory, copying the ${build.standalone.demo} and ${build.webapp} directories
somewhere else provides you with a simple standalone Cocoon installation, meant for
test and demo purposes.

To start this standalone demo use either "./cocoon.sh servlet" or "cocoon.bat servlet" in the
standalone-demo directory.

The webapp directory must be found as "../webapp" for this to work:

        common-parent-directory
                |
                +----------- standalone-demo
                +----------- webapp

Note that the version of the jetty servlet engine that is included with this demo
is not the full version. For production uses, we recommend that you get a complete
servlet engine and install it according to your needs.

Have fun!
Your friendly neighbourhood Cocoon team.
