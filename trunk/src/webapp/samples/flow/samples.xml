    <sample name="Calculator" href="calc/">
    A simple web-based calculator that uses javascript on the server side
    to describe the web application flow between screens in a coherent 
    unique location and continuations to maintain state between requests.
   </sample>
    <sample name="Calculator 2" href="jxcalc/">
     Same sample as the calculator but using the JXGenerator instead of XSP.
    </sample>
   <sample name="User Preferences" href="prefs/">
    A common portion of an application which requires users to be
	registered. This example shows how to use java objects from the 
	javascript flow as it is best practice to put business logic into
	strongly-typed java objects and use javascript to describe only the
	page flow.
