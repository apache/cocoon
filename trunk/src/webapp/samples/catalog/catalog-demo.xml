  <para>This sample application demonstrates the use of catalogs for
   entity resolution. &note; see the Apache Cocoon documentation
   <link href="../../docs/userdocs/concepts/catalog.html">Entity resolution with
   catalogs</link> for the full background and explanation, and the XML
   source of this document (catalog-demo.xml).
  </para>

  <para>This top-level XML instance document is catalog-demo.xml - it declares
   three other XML sub-documents as external entities and then includes
   them in the sections below. The real system identifiers will be looked
   up in the catalog, to resolve the actual location of the resource.
  </para>

  <para>The Document Type Definition (DTD) is declared using both a public
   identifier and a system identifier. The system identifier for the DTD is
   a network-based resource (which is deliberately non-existent). However,
   the catalog overrides that remote DTD to instead use a copy from the
   local filesystem at the location defined by the catalog entry. Note that
   it is via the use of a public identifier that we gain this power.
  </para>

  <para>The internal DTD subset of the top-level document instance goes on
   to declare the three external sub-document entities using various means.
   It also declares and includes the ISOnum set of character entities,
   so that we can use entities like &amp;frac12; (to represent &frac12;).
   Finally the internal DTD subset declares an internal general entity
   for &quot;note&quot;.
  </para>
 </section>

 <section>
  <para>testpub ... this entity is declared with a PUBLIC identifier and a
   bogus system identifier (which will be overridden by the catalog)
  </para>
  &testpub;
 </section>

 <section>
  <para>testsys ... this entity is declared with a SYSTEM identifier
   (which will be resolved by the catalog)
  </para>
  &testsys;
 </section>

 <section>
  <para>testovr ... is declared with a PUBLIC identifier and a system
   identifier (the catalog is set to not override this one, so the
   declared system identifier is used)
  </para>
  &testovr;
 </section>
