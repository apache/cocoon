- replace <map:parameter> in sitemap with <map:argument>

- pass the bizData and the continuation as arguments to the Request
instead of Environment, to prevent clashes with the SourceResolver.

- allow the ability to specify the continuation handler function in
cocoon.xconf, or even better in <map:continue>.

- [in progress] implement a transformer for JPath, in addition to the jpath.xsl
logicsheet. This should allow template pages to be created without the
need for XSP, which requires a Java compiler.

WISH LIST:
==========

- [ADVANCED] implement leaky bucket algorithm or similar to protect
the server from creating too many continuations.

- [ADVANCED] define a boolean parameter, to be set in either
cocoon.xconf or web.xml, that specifies that session affinity is to be
used when creating continuations. This means that when the root node
in a WebContinuation tree is created, a session object is also
created. This allows for continuations to be created and looked up on
the same app server in clustered servers.

- [ADVANCED] add support for serializing continuations in a database,
for long-lived transactions.
