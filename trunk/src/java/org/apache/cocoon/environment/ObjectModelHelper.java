/**
 * A set of constants and methods to access the content of the object model.
 * <p>
 * The object model is a <code>Map</code> used to pass information about the
 * calling environment to the sitemap and its components (matchers, actions,
 * transformers, etc).
 * <p>
 * This class provides accessors only for the objects in the object model that are
 * common to every environment and which can thus be used safely. Some environments
 * provide additional objects, but they are not described here and accessing them
 * should be done in due cause since this ties the application to that particular
 * environment.
