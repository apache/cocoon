/**
 * TargetFactory for {@link org.apache.log.output.io.StreamTarget}.
 *
 * This factory is able to create different StreamTargets according to the following
 * configuration syntax:
 * <pre>
 * &lt;stream id="foo"&gt;
 *  &lt;stream&gt;<i>stream-context-name</i>&lt;/stream&gt;
 *  &lt;format type="<i>raw|pattern|extended|xml|cocoon</i>"&gt;<i>pattern to be used if needed</i>&lt;/format&gt;
 * &lt;/stream&gt;
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>The "stream-context-name" is the name of an <code>java.io.OutputStream</code> that
 * is fetched in the context. This context contains two predefined streams :
 * <li>"<code>System.out</code>" for the system output stream,</li>
 * <li>"<code>System.err</code>" for the system error stream.</li>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>The syntax of "format" is the same as in <code>CocoonTargetFactory</code>.</p>
