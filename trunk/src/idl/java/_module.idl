/**

 *   This module contains all &quot;native&quot; objects visible from
 *   scripting layers available in Cocoon.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   In languages such as JavaScript there is no need to implement wrapper
 *   for those object, as commodity ones are usually provided by the scripting
 *   framework.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   It is required, though, to provide the definition of all Java
 *   &quot;native&quot; ojbects accessible from the Apache Cocoon scripting
 *   layers, because if any of the future scripting environment implemented
 *   does not support automatic wrapping, developers will have to implement
 *   those manually.
