  What is it?
  -----------

  Cocoon is a 100% pure Java publishing framework that relies on 
  new W3C technologies (such as XML and XSL) to provide web content.

  The Cocoon project aims to change the way web information is created, 
  rendered and delivered. This new paradigm is based on fact that document 
  content, style and logic are often created by different individuals or 
  working groups.
  
  Cocoon aims to a complete separation of the three layers, allowing the 
  three layers to be indipendently designed, created and managed, reducing 
  management overhead, increasing work reuse and reducing time to market.


  Where is it?
  ------------

  The home page for the Cocoon project can be found in the Apache XML Project 
  web site (http://xml.apache.org/cocoon/). There you also find information
  on how to download the latest release as well as all the other information
  you might need regarding this project.


  Requirements
  ------------

  Cocoon is implemented both as a Java servlet and a Java command line
  application. The following requirements exist for installing it:
  
   o  A Java 1.1 or later compatible virtual machine for your operating system.

   o  Server API 2.x Servlet Engine (optional for command line operation).
   

  Installation Instructions and Documentation
  -------------------------------------------

  The documentation available as of the date of this release is
  included in the "docs/" directory (unless you got this from CVS,
  in which case you need to run build docs, which generates documentation
  in the build/docs directory).

  Look for the most updated documentation on the Cocoon web site under
  the Apache XML Project (http://xml.apache.org/cocoon/).


  Release Notes for Cocoon 1.8
  ----------------------------

  There are no reported major issues with this release.

  As usual, if upgrading from an earlier release, you need to replace your
  cocoon.properties file with the one supplied in
  src/org/apache/cocoon/cocoon.properties,
  (then make any site-specific adjustments if you have any),
  or Cocoon will very likely not work at all.

  *** IMPORTANT ***
  If you get an error message about ProducerFromRequest, this means
  that you forgot to do the above. See the FAQ for more details.

  Note also that you need an additional library, new to 1.8,
  turbine-pool.jar, which is in the /lib directory, to be visible
  to the servlet engine. See the installation instructions.

  As usual, changes since previous releases are documented in docs/changes.html
  Highlights include:

  * Database connection pooling
  * Numerous bugfixes, including better Servlet 2.0 compatibility
  * Increased performance for heavy load conditions
  * Also increased speed for some XSP pages which include complex Nodes
  * New ESQL logicsheet allowing easy post-processing of resultsets in XSP
  * Improved documentation, with new expanded FAQ
  * More installation instructions for more different servlet engines
  * Experimental FP taglib for form-handling and other tasks
  * Jikes support for faster XSP page compilation


  Licensing and legal issues
  --------------------------
