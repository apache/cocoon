  What is it?
  -----------

  Cocoon is a 100% pure Java publishing framework that relies on 
  new W3C technologies (such as XML, and XSL) to provide web content.

  The Cocoon project aims to change the way web information is created, 
  rendered and delivered. This new paradigm is based on fact that document 
  content, style and logic are often created by different individuals or 
  working groups.
  
  Cocoon aims to a complete separation of the three layers, allowing the 
  three layers to be indipendently designed, created and managed, reducing 
  management overhead, increasing work reuse and reducing time to market.
