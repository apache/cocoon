<h1 align="center">Source Documentation via XML</h1>
<p align="center">by Kenneth Murphy</p>
<h2 align="left">Introduction</h2>
<blockquote>We are currently working on enhancing the documentation provided for the
Cocoon XML publishing framework by converting javadoc commented source code into
XML for use within Cocoon.</blockquote>
<h2>The plan</h2>
<blockquote><p>In order to do this we are currently planning to implement the following
phases</p>
<ol>
  <li>Develop a JavaDoc XML DTD that acts as a data structure representing the
    information provided by the rootDoc object of the SUN Javadoc program to a
    plugged doclet. This DTD is intended to closely mirror the look of a raw
    java source file.</li>
  <li>Develop a JavaDoc doclet (JavaDocXML) that takes the information from the
    JavaDoc rootDoc object and converts it into an XML file using the
    javadoc.dtd.</li>
  <li>Wrap the javadoc with XML doclet invocation into a cocoon producer as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>reads the document from the file system&nbsp;</li>
      <li>spawns the javadoc tool using the javadoc XML servlet and using the
parameters found in the "javadoc makefile"&nbsp;</li>
      <li>produces the XML output as a single document</li>
      <li>the Cocoon engine process it with the stylesheet indicated (from
command line or whatever)</li>
      <li>formats it either as PDF or HTML or whatever depending on the chosen
        stylesheet. (the HTML formatter will be able to split a single
XML document into several ones based on special page-break tags or PIs
or using FO directly)&nbsp;</li>
      <li>formatter will also be able to react on the SVG namespace
inlining vector graphics or formatted as raster graphics.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Some final formats we could produce are:
    <ul>
      <li>javadoc.dtd ---&gt; javadoc_html.dtd ---&gt; HTML (this would create a
        javadoc that looks like the current HTML javadoc standard).</li>
      <li>javadoc.dtd ---&gt; docBook.dtd&nbsp; (this would facilitate printed
        books based having heavy content about java API's. For example &quot;The
        JDBC API Tutorial and Reference: 2nd Edition&quot; could make heavy use
        of this.</li>
      <li>javadoc.dtd ---&gt; ebook.dtd (this would facilitate the electronic
        version of documentation)</li>
      <li>javadoc.dtd ---&gt; ??? ---&gt; pdf&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Using this method we will then enhance the existing Cocoon documentation to provide rich documentation
    using some subset of the above formats.</li>
  <li>Finally, we can incorporate XML versions of UML vector diagrams to further enhance the
    source code documentation.</li>
</ol></blockquote>
<h2>Progress to date</h2>
<blockquote><p><b>Current Status:</b> Phase 2</p>
<p>Items currently under development:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Phase 1
    <ul>
      <li><a href="javadoc_dtd.txt">javadoc.dtd</a></li>
      <li><a href="engine_xml.txt">sample</a>
        (this is a mockup of what the documentation of <a href="engine_java.txt">org.apache.cocoon.Engine</a>
        would look like in XML)
        <ul>
          <li>Note: I still need to update the sample to reflect the use of
            namespaces and the addition of the interfaceref element</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Phase 2
    <ul>
      <li>Working on XML javadoc doclet</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul></blockquote>
<h2>To do</h2>
<blockquote><p>Currently, I am needing lots of feedback on the javadoc.dtd. We can't proceed
to phase 2 until we feel we are on the right track with the DTD. It doesn't need
to be perfect, but it should be close. When I get the next round of feedback, I
am planning on adding &quot;import&quot; as an element of class. I am also
planning on moving the position of the element &quot;doc&quot; to the start of
each place it is appropriate. They will more closely reflect the source code and
it just makes since to put the documentation before not after what you are
talking about.</p>
