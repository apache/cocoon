  <s1 title="Important Notice">

   <p><strong>IMPORTANT: Before posting a question or problem to any mailing list,
    </strong>please first look at the <connect href="faq.xml">FAQs</connect>
    and the <link href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/">mailing list
    archives</link> to avoid asking a question which has already been
    asked and answered dozens of times before!
   </p>
  </s1>

  <s1 title="Cocoon Users">
   <p><link href="mailto:cocoon-users-subscribe@xml.apache.org">Subscribe</link>
      <link href="mailto:cocoon-users-unsubscribe@xml.apache.org">Unsubscribe</link>
   </p>

   <p>The general Cocoon list, for problems, bug reports, asking for advice on how
    best to implement a site, comparisons with other XML frameworks, etc.
    But don't forget to look in the FAQ first, please!</p>

   <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> If you are posting about a problem you are having
    (as most people do), it will aid in finding a speedy resolution if you provide
    full configuration details (especially the <strong>Cocoon version number</strong>,
    but also your operating system, JDK version, and servlet engine), and full details
    of any errors encountered (including full error messages and stack traces).</p>

   <p>If you would like to make commercial solicitations, please ask permission from
     the list moderator first.</p>

   <note>This list is moderated, so the first time you post, there will be a
    delay before your post is reviewed and accepted. This is to prevent spam.</note>
  </s1>

  <s1 title="Cocoon Dev">
   <p><link href="mailto:cocoon-dev-subscribe@xml.apache.org">Subscribe</link>
      <link href="mailto:cocoon-dev-unsubscribe@xml.apache.org">Unsubscribe</link>
   </p>

   <p>This list is for developers <strong>working on</strong> or wanting to work on
    Cocoon itself (not developers merely working <strong>with</strong> Cocoon),
    for code patches to Cocoon to be posted (please use <code>diff -u</code> format),
    and for general Cocoon 2 questions.</p>

   <p>Note this is <strong>NOT</strong> for general Cocoon 1 questions like "Why
    isn't Cocoon working on my machine?" - 
    please ask those sorts of questions cocoon users (after reading the
    FAQ first, of course).</p>

   <note>This list is moderated, so the first time you post, there will be a
    delay before your post is reviewed and accepted. This is to prevent spam.</note>
  </s1>

  <s1 title="Cocoon Cvs">
   <p><link href="mailto:cocoon-cvs-subscribe@xml.apache.org">Subscribe</link>
      <link href="mailto:cocoon-cvs-unsubscribe@xml.apache.org">Unsubscribe</link>
   </p>

   <p>This <strong>read-only</strong> list sends out notification messages detailing
    any change made to the CVS repository where all the source code and libraries
    are stored for development purposes. The average user probably doesn't need to
    subscribe to this list.</p>
