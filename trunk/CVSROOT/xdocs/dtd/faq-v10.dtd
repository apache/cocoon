     Apache FAQ DTD (Version 1.0)

PURPOSE:
  This DTD was developed to create a simple yet powerful document 
  type for software FAQ's for use with the Apache projects.  
  It is an XML-compliant DTD and it's maintained by the Apache XML 
  project.

TYPICAL INVOCATION:

  <!DOCTYPE document PUBLIC
       "-//APACHE//DTD FAQ Vx.yz//EN"
       "http://xml.apache.org/DTD/faq-vxyz.dtd">

  where 
  
    x := major version
    y := minor version
    z := status identifier (optional)
      
NOTES:  
  FAQs represent a powerful knowledge base and a very good way of solving
  common user problems reducing messages on mail lists and reducing the effort
  required for software installation and usage. Thid DTD want to be a common
  format for FAQ interchange to allow FAQ-O-Matic-type workgroup services to 
  be published in other formats as well as enhancing data interchange.
