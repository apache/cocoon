 <question>I get the exception <em>java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: sun/tools/javac/Main</em></question>
 <answer>
 <p>
  Look at the question below.
 </p>
 </answer>
</faq>

<faq>
 <question>I can't get XSP to work. What might be wrong?</question>
 <answer>
  <p>
   The XSP processor requires a single configuration that might cause problems:
   the repository location for compiled server pages.
  </p>

<source>processor.xsp.repository = ./repository</source>

  <p>
   If the process that runs the servlet engine doesn't have both reading
   and writing persmissions on that directory, the XSP processor won't work, so
   make sure you locate that directory to a safe place.
  </p>

  <note><strong>Warning:</strong>
    Since this directory may contain security sensible information, make sure
    you deny access (even read-only) to untrusted users.
  </note>

  <p>
   Another common problem is the system complaining about missing classes such as:
  </p>

  <source>java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: sun/tools/javac/Main</source>

  <p>
   If this happens, make sure you have installed the <code>tools.jar</code>
   package you find in <code>[jdk_home]/lib/tools.jar</code>.
  </p>
 </answer>
</faq>

<faq>
 <question>I get the exception <em>Can't create store repository: //./repository.
Make sure it's there or you have writing permissions.</em> How do I fix this?
 </question>
 <answer>
  <p>Create a directory where the servlet engine process is owner and has 600 access mask.
  Then change the following configuration to match the absolute path:</p>

  <source>processor.xsp.repository = /absolute/path/to/repository</source>

  <p>then restart your servlet engine.</p>

  <note>The repository may contain sensible information you don't want untrusted
  users to gain access to. This is why you should restrict both write and read
  by all but the servlet engine process.</note>
 </answer>
</faq>

<faq>
 <question>I get the exception telling me that the method 
 <em>org.apache.xerces.dom.ElementImpl.normalize(ElementImpl.java:290)</em>
 could not be found. What's wrong?</question>
 <answer>
  <p>This happens because Cocoon needs a DOM-leve2 implementation and you
  probably have a DOM-level1 included in your classpath _before_ <code>xerces.jar</code>.</p>
  <p>So, either remove the instances of your DOM-level1 packages (normally included
  in <code>xml.jar</code> or <code>jtidy.jar</code>) or place the <code>xerces.jar</code>
  archive that comes with Cocoon <em>before</em> all the other jar packages
  in your classpath. This should fix your problem.</p>
 </answer>
</faq>

<faq>
 <question>what are the other jar files shipped with Cocoon for? do I need to include them into my classpath?</question>
 <answer>
  <p>They are for building Cocoon and creating its docs from XML but they are not used by Cocoon at runtime so, if you
  don't plan to modify and recompile Cocoon or its documentation, you can safely ignore them.</p>
 </answer>
</faq>

<faq>
 <question>can I place <em>cocoon.jar</em> in my servlet context or servlet zone instead of my classpath?</question>
 <answer>
  <p>Due to a problem in most custom classloader implementations (for example, both JServ and Tomcat suffer from this problem) local resources
  cannot be loaded if they are located in custom repositories and packaged inside zip/jar files.</p>
  <p>A workaround is to expand the <em>cocoon.jar</em> file and like that directory as your servlet context repository
  or place the required resources in your classpath or wait for this problem to be fixed.</p>
 </answer>
</faq>

<faq>
 <question>I get the exception <em>java.lang.AbstractMethodError: org/apache/jserv/JServContext.getContext</em>. What's wrong?</question>
 <answer>
  <p>You are probably using JServ with the wrong version of the Servlet Library. JServ supports Servlet API 2.0
  and is not forward compatible with the newer version shipped with Cocoon. Cocoon is Servlet API 2.2 compatible and
  requires the servlet_2.2.jar package to compile correctly, but works is back compatible with old servlet engines.</p>
  <p>To fix the problem you must set the Servlet API 2.0 version in your classpath instead of the one shipped with
  cocoon. Read the JServ installation instructions for more info on this.</p>
 </answer>
</faq>

<faq>
 <question>Why can't I place <code>cocoon.jar</code> in my servlet repository?</question>
 <answer>
  <p>Since Cocoon is a web application, it should reside on servlet repository while all the
  libraries it uses should be place in the classpath. This would allow a single
  servlet engine to host more than one Cocoon instances with different classloaders
  and different security restrictions.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, due to specific needs of the XSP subsystem and some Java 1.1
  classloading limitations, this cannot be done.</p>
  <p>We are working for make this possible on Cocoon2, but assume this will
  require at least Java 1.2</p>
 </answer>
</faq>

<faq>
 <question>Why the LDAP processor doesn't work?</question>
 <answer>
  <p>Make sure you have the <link href="http://java.sun.com/products/jndi/index.html">Sun JNDI API</link>
   package installed in your classpath.</p>
 </answer>
</faq>

<faq>
 <question>Why DCP doesn't work with EcmaScript anymore? Where do I find the class <code>FESI/jslib/JSObject</code>?</question>
 <answer>
  <p>Since Cocoon now ships with all the required packages and Fesi is a
  very big package, we decided to make Ecmascript support for DCP optional.</p>
  <p>So, you should turn on the language interpretation in the cocoon
  configurations and place the <link href="http://home.worldcom.ch/jmlugrin/fesi/download.html">
  FESI</link> package in your classpath.</p>
  <note>the DCP processor should be considered deprecated and we do not guarantee
  that will be supported in future versions. We highly suggest you to
  transfor all of your DCP pages into XSP pages.</note>
 </answer>
</faq>

<faq>
 <question>How come Apache is not redirecting requests to Cocoon?</question>
 <answer>
 <p>There is a bug in mod_jserv that makes it dependent on its configuration
 position. If you use <em>ApJServHandler</em> you should change this to more
 standard <em>Action and AddHandler</em>. If you installed an old version
 of Cocoon, read again the installation instructions to find a solutions for
 this problem. (thanks to Dan Egnor for finding and solving the problem).</p>
 </answer>
</faq>

<faq>
 <question>How do I pipe my servlet output into Cocoon?</question>
 <answer>
  <p>Simple answer: <em>you don't!!!</em> read <connect href="dynamic.xml">the page
  about dynamic content</connect> to find out equivalent ways to do what you need.</p>
  <p>Complex answer: the Servlet API <em>was not</em> designed with servlet
  chaining capabilities in mind. Servlet chaining was a night hack of the
  original Java web server authors that allowed to pipe one servlet output
  into the request of another. Currently (version 2.2) the Servlet API spec
  doesn't allow a servlet to post-process the output of another servlet, so,
  since Cocoon is a servlet, there is no portable way for it to call
  your servlet and to process its output.</p>
  <p>The Cocoon Project is in close contact with the Servlet API Expert Group at
  Sun (being Stefano Mazzocchi a member of that board) and will propose
  post-processing hooks for inclusion in the next Servlet API specifications.
  Since this is work in progress, please, don't fill up the mail list with
  questions about this: Cocoon will reflect the API changes as soon as they
  are publicly available.</p>

 <question>Where do I get more information on XSL and XML?</question>
 <answer>
  <p>
    The web community is very exited about XML and XSL and many sources of
    information are coming up even if these languages are fairly new. Here is a list of

<faq>
 <question>Are there document translations to other languages?</question>
 <answer>
  <p>Given the problems we already have with documentation (which is never big and good enough),
  the Cocoon Project uses English as its standard and only documentation language. This is also
  the only language used in the mail lists. Also, the Cocoon distribution will contain
  English documentation only to reduce updating problems.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, we welcome any effort that provides document translations and
  we will keep here links to those translated documents.</p>
  <ul>
   <li><link href="http://www.epita.net">French Translation</link></li>
  </ul>
  <note>The Cocoon Project is not directly involved in these translating efforts
  and we are not resposible for any lack of synch between the official Cocoon
  documentation and the translated version. For this reason, do not contact
  the Cocoon Project but directly the people that provide the translation. Thank you.</note>

 <question>Are external entities still broken?</question>
 <answer>
  <p>No, external entity support has been fixed for both absolute and relative
  URIs. Note that ProjectX and Xerces behave differently on these but this
  is not something we are in control of.</p>
 </answer>

<faq>
 <question>I see that Cocon 1.x has starting to incorporate features planned for
 Cocoon 2.x, why?</question>
 <answer>
  <p>We believe that smooth project evolution is much better than step-wise
  revolutionary paths. For this reason, we'll try hard to incorporate all the
  Cocoon2 features in the main project thus limiting the porting effort for you
  over time.</p>
  <p>Note that this doesn't mean that Cocoon won't change in the future and we
  state clearly that we do care about back compatibility but only when this is
  not limiting the evolution of he platform too much.</p>
  <p>For this reason, while the DOM->SAX evolution might be totally painless, the
  sitemap proposal will completely change the Cocoon configurations. Anyway, Cocoon
  has a long way to go and if it changes during its evolution to a final state,
  don't complain: you have been warned.</p>
  <p>However, we DO consider and value the time you invested in Cocoon so we'll
  do our best to make sure that unneeded back incompatibilities don't get included.</p>
 </answer>
</faq>

<faq>
 <question>The XSL book I read says the correct way of indicating the XSL stylesheet is by
    using the XML processing instruction <code>&lt;?xml:stylesheet?&gt;</code> while Cocoon is
    using <code>&lt;?xml-stylesheet?&gt;</code>. Who is right?
 </question>
 <answer>
  <p>The PI <code>&lt;?xml:stylesheet type=&quot;text/xsl&quot; href=&quot;&quot;?&gt;</code>
  is the old method of associating a stylesheet with an XML document. Unfortunately, this
  technology is rapidly changing and your books should warn you that the topic they are
  discussing is not even in W3C Recommendation state. Which means that more changes are on
  their way.</p>
  <p>The current and proper way to associate a stylesheet with an XML document can be found at
  <link href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-stylesheet">http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-stylesheet</link> and
  clearly indicates that <code>&lt;?xml-stylesheet ...?&gt;</code> is the proper way.</p>

<faq>
 <question>
    I think that using Processing Instructions to &quot;chain&quot;
    document layers somehow violates the context separation since I would like
    to be able to place style sensible information in sessions or request
    parameters. What do you think about this?
 </question>
 <answer>
  <p>You are right, PI reaction breaks the context separation and it's, at the
    very end, the wrong approach. To follow a complete &quot;model, view,
    controller&quot; design pattern, one should be able to associate a different
    processing chain for each requested URI and for every possible request state
    (with request parameters, session parameters and environment parameters).</p>
  <p>The proposed solution (as you read in the <connect href="cocoon2.xml">Cocoon2
    outline</connect>) is to have a site map where site
    managers decide what processing chain to apply to each possible request.
    This somehow follows the mod_rewrite model in the Apache Web Server, but
    rather than URL rewriting, the site map allows site designers to control the
    behavior of their documents in one place without having to modify every
    single reactive PI in each source file.</p>
  <p>So, you've been warned: the PIs will go away, current functionality will
    remain but the processing management will be abstracted one layer up.</p>

<question>What is WAP and how do I browse WML?</question>
<answer>
  <p>WAP stands for Wireless Application Protocol and WML stands for Wireless
    Markup Language. For more information about these two, please refer to the
    <link href="http://www.wapforum.org">WAP Forum</link>. For a client able
    to browse WML 1.1, Cocoon has been tested with the
    <link href="http://www.nokia.com">Nokia WAP Toolkit</link> which
    emulates a Nokia WAP cell phone on your desktop.</p>

<faq>
<question>What is VoxML and how do I browse VML?</question>
<answer>
  <p>VoxML is a voice markup language, designed to allow direct integration
    between voice recognition/synthesis software and web technologies.
    The Cocoon VML samples have been tested with the
    <link href="http://www.voxml.org">Motorola VoxML SDK 1.1</link>(for windows)
    which is freely available.</p>
</answer>
</faq>

<faq>
<question>Why is my Internet Explorer not showing PDF or VRML samples?</question>
<answer>
  <p>This is a long-time problem with internet explorer which doesn't look for
  the MIME type sent by the http response, but rather parsers the file extention
  to determine what program should open it (unlike other browsers which are much
  smarter). There is a trick that forces IE to look at the MIME type, this is
  adding a <em>'?'</em> at the end of your URI. Even if Cocoon is ignoring
  this, IE won't and will react on the MIME type and will trigger the right
  plugin/application for that content.</p>
</answer>
</faq>

<faq>
<question>When I compile Cocoon on my system, I get all a bunch of errors. What's wrong?</question>
<answer>
  <p>You probably didn't add all the needed packages to your compiler's classpath.
    Note that Cocoon supports much more packages than you normally use and you should have
    them all to compile the full source code (this is why the cocoon.jar is distributed). To
    avoid this, simply remove (or rename) the classes that wrap around the packages you don't
    use.</p>
  <p>Note that if you tried to compile Cocoon.java alone, many classes are not compiled
  because there is no hardcoded reference to them. Cocoon uses dynamic loading based on its
  property file to get the modules it needs when started. For this reason, the compiler is
  not able to tell which class will be use and its dependency checks are never complete. The
  only way to compile it is to manually indicate all the files to compile or to use the
  makefiles after removing the unwanted wrapper classes for the packages you don't have or
  you don't want.</p>
  <p>Note that Cocoon is built using Ant: please, refer to the build.xml file
  for more information on how to set up your system to compile Cocoon</p>

<faq>
 <question>Why the name &quot;Cocoon&quot;?</question>
 <answer>
  <p> (Cocoon's creator Stefano Mazzocchi answers): It's a pretty stupid reason and a funny
  story: I spent my 1998 Xmas vacation with my girlfriend up on the Alps at her cottage. One
  night I couldn't sleep, I went to watch some TV and finishing reading the XSL
  documentation I brought with me. Being a science fiction <em>afficionado</em>, I found out
  that Ron Howard's movie <em>Cocoon</em> was on and I started watching it. The idea of the XSL
  rendering servlet stoke me like the alien &quot;cocoons&quot; in the pool stroke those old men in the
  movie and, while watching, I started paper-coding it right away. After a while the movie
  was over and the publishing framework designed. The name &quot;Cocoon&quot; seemed right
  for the thing, meaning to be a way to bring new life to old ideas as well as to create <em>cocoons</em>
  for such new ideas to become beautiful butterflies. :-)</p>
