<faq>
 <question>I keep on getting OutOfMemoryErrors but I've given the JVM
 a lot of memory. Are you sure this is not a memory leak? How do I fix this, then?
 </question>
 <answer>
  <p>This is not a memory leak but an expected behavior. Which means: you can
  tune the Cocoon configurations to avoid this.</p>
  <p>The key is the <code>store.memory</code> configuration. This tells cocoon
  to leave that much memory to the system for normal operation. Everything
  else is taken by the memory cache!</p>
  <p>If the <code>store.memory</code> configuration is lower than the amount
  of memory required to process the running requests (all of them together!)
  it might happen (Cocoon tries to do some cache garbage collection if this
  happens) that OutOfMemoryErrors are triggered.</p>
  <p>If the problem persist even highering your store memory, then it's a bug
  and it should not happen.</p>
  <note>Since Cocoon 1.7, garbage collection was added to the cache system
  and this should prevent these OutOfMemory on almost all the possible circumstances</note>

<faq>
 <question>I can't get XSP to work. What might be wrong?</question>
 <answer>
  <p>
   The XSP processor requires a single configuration that might cause problems:
   the repository location for compiled server pages.
  </p>

<source>processor.xsp.repository = ./repository</source>

  <p>
   If the process that runs the servlet engine doesn't have both reading
   and writing persmissions on that directory, the XSP processor won't work, so
   make sure you locate that directory to a safe place.
  </p>

  <note><strong>Warning:</strong>
    Since this directory may contain security sensible information, make sure
    you deny access (even read-only) to untrusted users.

 <question>Why the LDAP processor doesn't work?</question>
 <answer>
  <p>Make sure you have the <link href="http://java.sun.com/products/jndi/index.html">Sun JNDI API</link>
   package installed in your classpath.</p>
 </answer>
</faq>

<faq>
 <question>Why DCP doesn't work with EcmaScript anymore?</question>
 <answer>
  <p>Since Cocoon now ships with all the required packages and Fesi is a
  very big package, we decided to make Ecmascript support for DCP optional.</p>
  <p>So, you should turn on the language interpretation in the cocoon
  configurations and place the <link href="http://home.worldcom.ch/jmlugrin/fesi/download.html">
  FESI</link> package in your classpath.</p>
  <note>the DCP processor should be considered deprecated and we do not guarantee
  that will be supported in future versions. We highly suggest you to
  transfor all of your DCP pages into XSP pages.</note>

<faq>
 <question>How come Apache is not redirecting requests to Cocoon?</question>
 <answer>
 <p>There is a bug in mod_jserv that makes it dependent on its configuration
 position. If you use <em>ApJServHandler</em> you should change this to more
 standard <em>Action and AddHandler</em>. If you installed an old version
 of Cocoon, read again the installation instructions to find a solutions for
 this problem. (thanks to Dan Egnor for finding and solving the problem).</p>

<faq>
 <question>How do I pipe my servlet output into Cocoon?</question>
 <answer>
  <p>Simple answer: <em>you don't!!!</em> read <connect href="dynamic.xml">the page
  about dynamic content</connect> to find out equivalent ways to do what you need.</p>
  <p>Complex answer: the Servlet API <em>was not</em> designed with servlet
  chaining capabilities in mind. Servlet chaining was a night hack of the
  original Java web server authors that allowed to pipe one servlet output
  into the request of another. Currently (version 2.2) the Servlet API spec
  doesn't allow a servlet to post-process the output of another servlet, so,
  since Cocoon is a servlet, there is no portable way for it to call
  your servlet and to process its output.</p>
  <p>The Cocoon Project is in close contact with the Servlet API Expert Group at
  Sun (being Stefano Mazzocchi a member of that board) and will propose
  post-processing hooks for inclusion in the next Servlet API specifications.
  Since this is work in progress, please, don't fill up the mail list with
  questions about this: Cocoon will reflect the API changes as soon as they
  are publicly available.</p>

 <question>Are there document translations to other languages?</question>
 <answer>
  <p>Given the problems we already have with documentation (which is never big and good enough),
  the Cocoon Project uses English as its standard and only documentation language. This is also
  the only language used in the mail lists. Also, the Cocoon distribution will contain
  English documentation only to reduce updating problems.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, we welcome any effort that provides document translations and
  we will keep here links to those translated documents.</p>
  <ul>
   <li><link href="http://www.epita.net">French Translation</link></li>
  </ul>
  <note>The Cocoon Project is not directly involved in these translating efforts
  and we are not resposible for any lack of synch between the official Cocoon
  documentation and the translated version. For this reason, do not contact
  the Cocoon Project but directly the people that provide the translation. Thank you.</note>

 <question>How come Cocoon doesn't work on Tomcat 3.0?</question>
 <answer>
  <p>You must apply this patch to Tomcat 3.0 and recompile it or it won't work.
  This patch is already present in latest CVS code but in case you don't want
  to download the latest code you can apply this:</p>

 <question>Are external entities still broken?</question>
 <answer>
  <p>No, external entity support has been fixed for both absolute and relative
  URIs. Note that ProjectX and Xerces behave differently on these but this
  is not something we are in control of.</p>

<faq>
 <question>I see that Cocon 1.x has starting to incorporate features planned for
 Cocoon 2.x, why?</question>
 <answer>
  <p>We believe that smooth project evolution is much better than step-wise
  revolutionary paths. For this reason, we'll try hard to incorporate all the
  Cocoon2 features in the main project thus limiting the porting effort for you
  over time.</p>
  <p>Note that this doesn't mean that Cocoon won't change in the future and we
  state clearly that we do care about back compatibility but only when this is
  not limiting the evolution of he platform too much.</p>
  <p>For this reason, while the DOM->SAX evolution might be totally painless, the
  sitemap proposal will completely change the Cocoon configurations. Anyway, Cocoon
  has a long way to go and if it changes during its evolution to a final state,
  don't complain: you have been warned.</p>
  <p>However, we DO consider and value the time you invested in Cocoon so we'll
  do our best to make sure that unneeded back incompatibilities don't get included.</p>

<faq>
 <question>The XSL book I read says the correct way of indicating the XSL stylesheet is by
    using the XML processing instruction <code>&lt;?xml:stylesheet?&gt;</code> while Cocoon is
    using <code>&lt;?xml-stylesheet?&gt;</code>. Who is right?
 </question>
 <answer>
  <p>The PI <code>&lt;?xml:stylesheet type=&quot;text/xsl&quot; href=&quot;&quot;?&gt;</code>
  is the old method of associating a stylesheet with an XML document. Unfortunately, this
  technology is rapidly changing and your books should warn you that the topic they are
  discussing is not even in W3C Recommendation state. Which means that more changes are on
  their way.</p>
  <p>The current and proper way to associate a stylesheet with an XML document can be found at
  <link href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-stylesheet">http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-stylesheet</link> and
  clearly indicates that <code>&lt;?xml-stylesheet ...?&gt;</code> is the proper way.</p>

<faq>
 <question>
    I think that using Processing Instructions to &quot;chain&quot;
    document layers somehow violates the context separation since I would like
    to be able to place style sensible information in sessions or request
    parameters. What do you think about this?
 </question>
 <answer>
  <p>You are right, PI reaction breaks the context separation and it's, at the
    very end, the wrong approach. To follow a complete &quot;model, view,
    controller&quot; design pattern, one should be able to associate a different
    processing chain for each requested URI and for every possible request state
    (with request parameters, session parameters and environment parameters).</p>
  <p>The proposed solution (as you read in the <connect href="cocoon2.xml">Cocoon2
    outline</connect>) is to have a site map where site
    managers decide what processing chain to apply to each possible request.
    This somehow follows the mod_rewrite model in the Apache Web Server, but
    rather than URL rewriting, the site map allows site designers to control the
    behavior of their documents in one place without having to modify every
    single reactive PI in each source file.</p>
  <p>So, you've been warned: the PIs will go away, current functionality will
    remain but the processing management will be abstracted one layer up.</p>

<question>What is WAP and how do I browse WML?</question>
<answer>
  <p>WAP stands for Wireless Application Protocol and WML stands for Wireless
    Markup Language. For more information about these two, please refer to the
    <link href="http://www.wapforum.org">WAP Forum</link>. For a client able
    to browse WML 1.1, Cocoon has been tested with the
    <link href="http://www.nokia.com">Nokia WAP Toolkit</link> which
    emulates a Nokia WAP cell phone on your desktop.</p>

<question>What is VoxML and how do I browse VML?</question>
<answer>
  <p>VoxML is a voice markup language, designed to allow direct integration
    between voice recognition/synthesis software and web technologies.
    The Cocoon VML samples have been tested with the
    <link href="http://www.voxml.org">Motorola VoxML SDK 1.1</link>(for windows)
    which is freely available.</p>

<faq>
<question>Why is my Internet Explorer not showing PDF or VRML samples?</question>
<answer>
  <p>This is a long-time problem with internet explorer which, illegally,
  reacts on URI extention rathen than returned MIME type. The only think you can
  do for now is to map .pdf or .wrl to Cocoon for handling, but we know that
  sucks. Don't worry, in the future, the sitemap proposal will allow you
  to work around this magically. For now, just don't use IE :)</p>

<faq>
<question>When I compile Cocoon on my system, I get all a bunch of errors. What's wrong?</question>
<answer>
  <p>You probably didn't add all the needed packages to your compiler's classpath.
    Note that Cocoon supports much more packages than you normally use and you should have
    them all to compile the full source code (this is why the cocoon.jar is distributed). To
    avoid this, simply remove (or rename) the classes that wrap around the packages you don't
    use.</p>
  <p>Note that if you tried to compile Cocoon.java alone, many classes are not compiled
  because there is no hardcoded reference to them. Cocoon uses dynamic loading based on its
  property file to get the modules it needs when started. For this reason, the compiler is
  not able to tell which class will be use and its dependency checks are never complete. The
  only way to compile it is to manually indicate all the files to compile or to use the
  makefiles after removing the unwanted wrapper classes for the packages you don't have or
  you don't want.</p>
  <p>Note that Cocoon is built using Ant: please, refer to the build.xml file
  for more information on how to set up your system to compile Cocoon</p>

<faq>
 <question>Why the name &quot;Cocoon&quot;?</question>
 <answer>
  <p> (Cocoon's creator Stefano Mazzocchi answers): It's a pretty stupid reason and a funny
  story: I spent my 1998 Xmas vacation with my girlfriend up on the Alps at her cottage. One
  night I couldn't sleep, I went to watch some TV and finishing reading the XSL
  documentation I brought with me. Being a science fiction <em>afficionado</em>, I found out
  that Ron Howard's movie <em>Cocoon</em> was on and I started watching it. The idea of the XSL
  rendering servlet stoke me like the alien &quot;cocoons&quot; in the pool stroke those old men in the
  movie and, while watching, I started paper-coding it right away. After a while the movie
  was over and the publishing framework designed. The name &quot;Cocoon&quot; seemed right
  for the thing, meaning to be a way to bring new life to old ideas as well as to create <em>cocoons</em>
  for such new ideas to become beautiful butterflies. :-)</p>
