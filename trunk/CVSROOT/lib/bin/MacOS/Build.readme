Release:	Cocoon Version				: 1.7.5-dev	Build Version		            : 1.0	Author							: Jeremy Quinn <mailto:sharkbait@mac.com>	Date								: 00/06/15Description:	These files are to make it easier for MacOS users to compile Cocoon.	You will need to create "Build" an Application Wrapper, using Apple's MRJAppBuilder.	The properties file is pre-set up to execute Ant's "main" class, and has the correct classpaths	for the Cocoon 1.7.5-dev release.	Contents:	Build.properties	: Properties file for building Cocoon, optionally overrides built-in settings.	Build.readme			: this fileRequirements:	MRJ 2.2 (Mac Runtime for Java)	MRJ SDK 2.2, both available from <http://www.apple.com/java/>		Installation:	Using MRJAppBuilder, make an Application called "Build" in the MacOS folder.		1. Drag and drop "Build.properties" onto MRJAppBuilder		2. Set up the path to save the Application into the same folder		3. call it "Build"		4. Save the Application.	If you need to override the properties , edit "Build.properties" according to the instructions 	that come with MRJAppBuilder.Usage:	Launch your new "Build" Application. Compilation should commence almost immediately.On Error:	If there is a fatal problem with the compilation, it is possible that "Build"	will Quit before you had the chance to see what the error report in the Console window said.	To overcome this, uncomment the lines in the "Build.properties" file that redirect	error reporting to a file, so you can read what happened.Future Releases:	Future releases of any of the components that Cocoon uses will typically require	changes to the names of the packages in the Classpath sent to Ant.	Entering those changes into the file "Build.properties" enables you to 	override the properties built-in to the Application.
