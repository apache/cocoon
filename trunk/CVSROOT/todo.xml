   Work out how to integrate inline XSP docs (such as inline esql docs)

   Write a full guide to logicsheets, including: (1) What they are and how
   they work - explaining why XSP results can't be assigned to XSLT variables;
   (2) What all the supplied logicsheets do (long-term aim: document every tag
   and every attribute); (3) How to write your own and use it; (4) How to
   specify logicsheet execution order with the as-yet-undocumented 
   &lt;?xml-logicsheet?&gt; processing instruction. Partial contributions welcome! :-)

   Ensure that all HTML docs are not too wide for screen/printer width

  <action context="docs" bugid="17">
   FAQ (particularly) and XSP docs are too long lengthwise. Split them

   Make cache more configurable (e.g. to turn off per-user-agent caching,

   More logicsheets for common requirements, e.g. upload logicsheet.
   (see infozone, turbine, etc. for examples;
    O'Reilly is NOT open source) - but first fix
