   Work out how to integrate inline XSP docs (such as inline esql docs)

   Write a full guide to logicsheets, including: (1) What they are and how
   they work - explaining why XSP results can't be assigned to XSLT variables;
   (2) What all the supplied logicsheets do (long-term aim: document every tag
   and every attribute); (3) How to write your own and use it; (4) How to
   specify logicsheet execution order with the as-yet-undocumented 
   &lt;?xml-logicsheet?&gt; processing instruction. Partial contributions welcome! :-)

   Workaround redirect problem with Tomcat and IE and Cocoon
   (code written; just needs to be merged in.) I marked this high-priority
   because the only known workarounds are stop using Tomcat 3.1 or stop using
   IE(!) - both of which are unacceptable.
