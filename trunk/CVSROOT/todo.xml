  <action context="docs" assigned-to="RDG" bugid="8">
   Write a full guide to logicsheets, including: (1) What they are and how
   they work - explaining why XSP results can't be assigned to XSLT variables;
   (2) What all the supplied logicsheets do (long-term aim: document every tag
   and every attribute); (3) How to write your own and use it; (4) How to
   specify logicsheet execution order with the as-yet-undocumented 
   &lt;?xml-logicsheet?&gt; processing instruction. Partial contributions welcome! :-)

   Better support for not applying stylesheets for e.g. IE5.5.

  <action context="docs" bugid="17">
   FAQ (particularly) and XSP docs are too long lengthwise. Split them

   in separate methods.)

  <action context="code">
   More powerful request taglib, e.g. list of parameters are read into
   local variables.
  </action>
  <action context="code">
   More logicsheets for common requirements, e.g. upload logicsheet.
   (see infozone, turbine, etc. for examples;
    O'Reilly is NOT open source) - but first fix
