   Contribution / patch management system (will be primitive!)

   Work out how to integrate inline XSP docs (such as inline esql docs)
   into the build docs procedure. This will fix a dead link which leads
   on to the next item...

   Workaround redirect problem with Tomcat and IE and Cocoon
   (code written; just needs to be merged in.) I marked this high-priority
   because the only known workarounds are stop using Tomcat 3.1 or stop using
   IE(!) - both of which are unacceptable.

 <actions priority="medium">
  <action context="code" assigned-to="RDG">
   Write a LinkEncodingProcessor (useful for cookieless clients e.g. WML)
   which runs all HTTP links through response.encodeURL.
  </action>
  <action context="docs" assigned-to="RDG">
   Write a full guide to logicsheets, including: (1) What they are and how
   they work - explaining why XSP results can't be assigned to XSLT variables;
   (2) What all the supplied logicsheets do (long-term aim: document every tag
   and every attribute); (3) How to write your own and use it; (4) How to
   specify logicsheet execution order with the as-yet-undocumented 
   &lt;?xml-logicsheet?&gt; processing instruction. Partial contributions welcome! :-)

  <action context="code">
   Fix remaining caching bugs. Cleanup caching code, which is messy.

  <action context="code" assigned-to="RDG">
   Fix stylesheet-chaining bug.

   Add a working version of JQ's multiline string template to util logicsheet.

   Cleanup and improve documentation. (in progress.)

   Add standard WEB-INF/classes and WEB-INF/lib to XSP classpath.

  <action context="docs">
   Ensure that all HTML docs are not too wide for screen/printer width
   (as appropriate - there are separate directories for screen and
   printer docs).
  </action>
  <action context="docs">
   FAQ (particularly) and XSP docs are too long lengthwise. Split them
   up. Their length (or complexity)
   causes extremely slow rendering on Netscape 4.x and recent Mozilla builds.

 <actions priority="low">
  <action context="code">
   Add hooks for user-defined error-handling (better than just handle.errors.internally
   flag in cocoon.properties).

  <action context="docs">
   Make &lt;connect&gt; tags work correctly when xdocs are transformed to HTML docs.
  </action>
  <action context="code" assigned-to="RDG">
   Add GroupingProcessor which makes it easy to group elements together in bundles
   of N (this is messy in XSLT).

   Make cocoon.properties (i.e. Configurations objects) easily accessible from XSP.

   Fix Jikes compilation error reporting bug.
  </action>
  <action context="code">
   Make cache more configurable (e.g. to turn off per-user-agent caching,
   maybe for specific pages only). However, Mark Washeim thinks that this
   offers only "trivial" overhead reduction, even on large sites.
  </action>
  <action context="code">
   Better error reporting for typos in stylesheet URIs.

  <action context="code">
   Add Jeremy Quinn's multiline get-nested-content template to all relevant
   logicsheets.

   Automated test suite - maybe build upon samples and JMeter??
  </action>
  <action context="design">
   Work out best way of breaking the 64K method barrier in XSP.
   (The ESQL logicsheet already tries to address this by executing queries
   in separate methods.)
  </action>
  <action context="code">
   More powerful request taglib, e.g. list of parameters are read into
   local variables.
  </action>
  <action context="code">
   More logicsheets for common requirements, e.g. upload logicsheet.
   (see infozone, turbine, etc. for examples;
    O'Reilly is NOT open source) - but first fix
   tomcat+apache+cocoon upload bug.
