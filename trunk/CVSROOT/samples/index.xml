  <sample name="Hello World" url="hello/hello-page.xml">
   This is a very simple demostration of how to use Cocoon. A simple XML page
   is transformed into an HTML page.
  </sample>
  <sample name="Hello World (with external message)" url="entities/entities-page.xml">
   This is a very simple demostration of how to use Cocoon. Same page as above,
   but some of its content is included using XML external entities.
  </sample>
  <sample name="Hello World (with imported stylesheet)" url="import/import-page.xml">
   This is a very simple demostration of how to use Cocoon. Same page as above,
   but its stylesheet is an extention of the previous one and changes some
   of its properties.

 <group name="XML-ized web sites">
  <sample name="java.apache.org" url="sites/java.apache.org/news-page.xml">
   This page shows a much more complex example that shows how powerful
   is the style separation and how powerful XML+XSL can be even for
   static web publishing.

 <group name="Juicy Examples of XSLT Usage">
  <sample name="RSS Example" url="rss/publishing-rss.xml">
   This page shows the use of <a href="http://my.netscape.com/publish/">Netscape RSS format</a>
   for site description. This creates a simple way for one site to have 
   headlines for news or items on other sites. Checkout the <a href="http://java.apache.org/jetspeed/">
   JetSpeed project</a> for more information on this technology.

  <sample name="ApacheCON 2000 Slides" url="slides/slides.xml">
   This page replicates the slides that were presented by 
   <a href="mailto:stefano@apache.org">Stefano Mazzocchi</a>
   at ApacheCON 2000 to present Cocoon. They are presented here both as a 
   reference and example of complex use of multiple XSLT transformations 
   on the server side. NOTE: you need a CSS/PNG capable browser to view
   the slides.
  </sample>
  <sample name="Structure Formatting with XSLT" url="structure/slides.xml">
   This page shows the use of a general XSLT stylesheet that create a 
   tree view of the input file. The slides XML source is used as input.

 <group name="Dynamic content Generation">
  <sample name="First XSP Page" url="xsp/page.xml?message=Hello%20World!">
   This page shows the power of XSP technology with Java logic. In this page
   logic and content are mixed.
  </sample>

  <sample name="First XSP Page (pure content version)" url="xsp/clean-page.xml?message=Hello%20World!">
   This page generates the exact same output, but it's created by XSL-transforming
   a pure-content page into an XSP page, thus providing a complete separation
   between content and logic. Note that the transformation needed to generate
   the XSP page is compiled in, and for this reason it's not executed at request
   time. This is due to the fact that unlike other server pages technologies,
   XSP are written to be fully integrated with the XML model and languages.
  </sample>

  <sample name="First XSP Page (namespace library version)" url="xsp/lib-page.xml?message=Hello%20World!">
   This page generates the exact same output, but it's created by applying
   namespace-driven element libraries instead of applying directly an XSLT
   logicsheet. This allows easier reuse of what is usually called a "tag library"
   to create equivalent functionalities of other logic-free tag-driven
   dynamic content generation technologies (such as, for example,
   Allaire's ColdFusion or Ricoh's PIA).
  </sample>

  <sample name="DCP using Java" url="dcp/java/sample-page.xml">
   This page shows how you can use Cocoon to generate dynamic content using
   XML processing instructions to trigger Java logic execution.

 <!-- 
      Stupid IE has a bug in the handling of MIME-types and we fool it adding
      a '?' after the url. Tell me, isn't this totally nonsense? I mean, 
      Cocoon is simply ignoring that query so, while this
      is the worse hack I've ever seen, this is the only way we make IE
      do what it's supposed to do. Microsoft, listen up: patch the damn thing!

 <group name="Formatting Object Rendering">
  <sample name="Simple FO Example" url="fo/test-fo.xml?">
   This page shows some potentials of the XSL Formatting Object specifications
   tranformed into PDF (we suggest you to install Adobe Acrobat Reader as your
   browser plugin for smoother integration)
  </sample>

  <sample name="More complex FO + SVG Example" url="fo/test2-fo.xml?">
   This page shows higher potentials of the XSL Formatting Object specifications
   when mixed with other graphic outline specification such as SVG (Scalable
   Vector Graphics). Both are interpreted by FOP and rendered into PDF as
   area and vector graphics.
  </sample>

  <sample name="Novel FO formatting" url="fo/darkness-novel.xml?">
   In this example, part of Joseph Conrad's "The Heart of Darkness" novel
   is taken from its orginal style-free XML format and rendered into PDF
   using an XML->FO stylesheet.
  </sample>
 </group>

 <group name="New media for your web site">
  <sample name="SVG" url="svg/hello.xml?">
   In this example, we show how Cocoon is able to generate an SVG image
   out of a dynamically generated page. Database graphs and vector counters
   are just a few tags away.
  </sample>

  <sample name="VRML" url="vrml/hello.xml?">
   In this example, we show how Cocoon is able to generate virtual reality
   models by applying the appropriate stylesheet to an XML page.
  </sample>

  <sample name="Web and WAP" url="wap/example-portfolio.xml">
   In this example, we show how Cocoon is able to understand which browser
   is requesting the page and applies a different stylesheet to the same
   XML page to render on the different clients. This page is formatted in
   WML (Wireless Markup Language) if the Nokia Wap Toolkit 1.2 browser (which
   you could get for free from <a href="http://www.nokia.com">Nokia</a>)
   requests this page. Look into the example source to change this for your
   favorite WAP browser/cell-phone/PDA.
  </sample>

  <sample name="VoxML" url="vml/hello-page.xml">
   This page has the same exact source file as the hello world example, but
   the stylesheet formats it using the VoxML language. You page has been tested
   with the Motorola VoxML SDK which you get for free from
   <a href="http://www.motorola.com">Motorola</a>.
