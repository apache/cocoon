   This is an example of xinclude (combined with xslt, so you get 
   some browser-renderable output).  There are three xinclude 
   directives in it: a simple include parsed as text, a simple 
   include parsed as xml and a more complicated include using 
   xpointer parsed as xml.  Plus the xpointer included stanza 
   itself has an xinclude in it, illustrating nested xinclude.
