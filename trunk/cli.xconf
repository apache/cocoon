    |  This is the Apache Cocoon command line configuration file. 
    |  Here you give the command line interface details of where
    |  to find various aspects of your Cocoon installation.
    |
    |  If you wish, you can also use this file to specify the URIs
    |  that you wish to generate.
    |
    |  The current configuration information in this file is for
    |  building the Cocoon documentation. Therefore, all links here 
    |  are relative to the build context dir, which, in the build.xml 
    |  file, is set to ${build.context} 
    |
    |  Options:
    |    verbose:            increase amount of information presented
    |                        to standard output (default: false)
    |    follow-links:       whether linked pages should also be 
    |                        generated (default: true)
    |    precompile-only:    precompile sitemaps and XSP pages, but 
    |                        do not generate any pages (default: false)
    |    confirm-extensions: check the mime type for the generated page
    |                        and adjust filename and links extensions
    |                        to match the mime type 
    |                        (e.g. text/html->.html)
    |
    |  Note: Whilst using an xconf file to configure the Cocoon 
    |        Command Line gives access to more features, the use of 
    |        command line parameters is more stable, as there are 
    |        currently plans to improve the xconf format to allow 
    |        greater flexibility. If you require a stable and
    |        consistent method for accessing the CLI, it is recommended 
    |        that you use the command line parameters to configure 
    |        the CLI.</note>

       |  The context directory is usually the webapp directory
       |  containing the sitemap.xmap file.
       |
       |  The config file is the cocoon.xconf file.
       |
       |  The work directory is used by Cocoon to store temporary
       |  files and cache files.
       |  
       |  The destination directory is where generated pages will
       |  be written (assuming the 'simple' mapper is used, see 
       |  below)

       | Broken link reporting options:
       |   Report into a text file, one link per line:

       |   Report into an XML file:
       |     <broken-links type="xml" report="filename"/>
       |   Ignore broken links (default):

       |     
       |   Two attributes to this node specify whether a page should
       |   be generated when an error has occured. 'generate' specifies 
       |   whether a page should be generated (default: true) and
       |   extension specifies an extension that should be appended
       |   to the generated page's filename (default: none)
       |   
       |   Using this, a quick scan through the destination directory
       |   will show broken links, by their filename extension.

   <!--+
       | Specifies which URIs should be included or excluded, according
       | to wildcard patterns. 
       | 
       | By default, all URIs are included. If both include and exclude
       | patterns are specified, a URI is first checked against the 
       | include patterns, and then against the exclude patterns.
       | 
       | Multiple patterns can be given, using muliple include or exclude
       | nodes. 
       | 
       | The order of the elements is not significant, as only the first 
       | successful match of each category is used.
       | 
       | Currently, only the complete source URI can be matched (including
       | any URI prefix). Future plans include destination URI matching 
       | and regexp matching. If you have requirements for these, contact
       | dev@cocoon.apache.org.

       |  <uri> nodes specify the URIs that should be generated, and 
       |  where required, what should be done with the generated pages.
       |
       |  Append: append the generated page's URI to the end of the 
       |  source URI:
       |
       |   <uri type="append" src-prefix="documents/" src="index.html"

       |  use the destination URI:
       |
       |   <uri type="replace" src-prefix="documents/" src="index.html" 
       |   dest="build/dest/docs.html"/>

       |   <uri type="insert" src-prefix="documents/" src="index.html"

       |  be used.

       | <uri> nodes can be grouped together in a <uris> node. This 
       | enables a group of URIs to share properties. The following
       | properties can be set for a group of URIs:
       |   * follow-links:       should pages be crawled for links
       |   * confirm-extensions: should file extensions be checked
       |                         for the correct mime type
       |   * src-prefix:         all source URIs should be 
       |                         pre-pended with this prefix before
       |                         generation. The prefix is not 
       |                         included when calculating the 
       |                         destination URI

       |   * type:               the method to be used to calculate
       |                         the destination URI. See above
