    |  This is the Apache Cocoon command line configuration file. 
    |  Here you give the command line interface details of where
    |  to find various aspects of your Cocoon installation.
    |
    |  If you wish, you can also use this file to specify the URIs
    |  that you wish to generate.
    |
    |  The current configuration information in this file is for
    |  building the Cocoon documentation. Therefore, all links here 
    |  are relative to the build context dir, which, in the build.xml 
    |  file, is set to ${build.context} 
    |
    |  Options:
    |    verbose:            increase amount of information presented
    |                        to standard output (default: false)
    |    follow-links:       whether linked pages should also be 
    |                        generated (default: true)
    |    precompile-only:    precompile sitemaps and XSP pages, but 
    |                        do not generate any pages (default: false)
    |    confirm-extensions: check the mime type for the generated page
    |                        and adjust filename and links extensions
    |                        to match the mime type 
    |                        (e.g. text/html->.html)
    |
    |  Note: Whilst using an xconf file to configure the Cocoon 
    |        Command Line gives access to more features, the use of 
    |        command line parameters is more stable, as there are 
    |        currently plans to improve the xconf format to allow 
    |        greater flexibility. If you require a stable and
    |        consistent method for accessing the CLI, it is recommended 
    |        that you use the command line parameters to configure 
    |        the CLI.</note>

       |  The old behaviour - appends uri to the specified destination
