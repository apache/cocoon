This directory contains the instrumentation client that allows to remotely monitor the behaviour of a running Cocoon.

To activate Cocoon instrumentation, uncomment the "enable-instrumentation" and "instrumentation-config" servlet parameters in web.xml.

To start the GUI, type "build start-instrumentation-client" in the main Cocoon directory, then use "Instrument manager/Connect to instrument manager" to establish a connection with the Cocoon server.
