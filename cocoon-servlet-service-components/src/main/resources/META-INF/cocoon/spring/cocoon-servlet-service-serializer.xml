      - This method returns dummy mime type to satisfy pipeline's requirement to have mime type determined at setup phase.
      - In this serializer case it's not possible to satisfy this requirement so dummy value is returned and real is set in the
      - method org.apache.cocoon.servletservice.postable.components.ServletServiceSerializer#endDocument()
      - See http://article.gmane.org/gmane.text.xml.cocoon.devel/73261 for post explaining current (hacky) solution
