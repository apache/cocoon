    <s1 title="Concept">
      <p>An fd:output widget is similar to a field widget, but its value
      is not editable. The value of an output widget must be set programmatically
      (or through binding). An output widget does not read its value from
      the request, so is most useful in the case where the form is stored
      accross requests (automatically the case when using flowscript). An
      output widget does not perform any validation, it is always considered
      to be valid.</p>

      <note>It is likely that we'll add a generalized 'readonly' capability
      to all widgets. When we do that, fd:output will become obsolete and
      can be replaced by a 'readonly' field wiget. In the meantime you can
      safely use fd:output since this change won't have much impact.</note>

      <p><strong>Possible alternative:</strong> On each widget you can
      also store additional information
      (i.e. arbitrary Java objects) in attributes. See the Java API
      of the Widget interface, methods setAttribute and getAttribute.
      You can then retrieve these attributes using the JXTemplate generator.</p>
