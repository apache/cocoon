  <question>
   How can I turn my XSPs into Generators to get better performance?
  </question>
  <answer>
   <p>Cocoon will compile your XSP files into Java classes the first time they are requested. You can find them in your work directory, for example in 
tomcat/work/.../org/apache/cocoon/www/my_xsp.class. Once your XSP file is compiled, you can declare a new generator in your sitemap, for example:</p>

<source><![CDATA[
<map:generator type="myXSP" src="org.apache.cocoon.www.my_xsp"/>
]]></source>

<p>And then use it in a pipeline, for example: </p>

<source><![CDATA[
<map:generate type="myXSP"/>
]]></source>
