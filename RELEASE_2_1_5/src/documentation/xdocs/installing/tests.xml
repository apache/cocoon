 <s1 title="Overview of testing procedures">
  <p>
   There are some initial procedures available for you to ensure that
   Apache Cocoon can run properly on your particular computing platform
   and that the components do function properly.
  </p>
  <p>
   You can build upon this infrastructure to add your own tests, and to
   ensure that development work proceeds smoothly. The tests are located
   in the <code>src/test/</code> directory.
  </p>
 </s1>

 <s1 title="JUnit tests">
  <p>
   Run &quot;<code>build test</code>&quot; to conduct an initial set of
   automated JUnit test cases,
   e.g. Test various transformers;
   Test the methods for getting platform-dependent filesystem pathnames; etc.
  </p>

  <s2 title="How to add more tests">
   <p>
    As there is already a nice junit framework available, it is not that
    difficult to add junit tests for any transformer. In short:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>Create XYTransformerTestCase.java</li>
    <li>Create XYTransformerTestCase.xconf</li>
    <li>Edit the transformers section in XYTransformerTestCase.xtest
     for XYTransformerTestCase</li>
    <li>Add testABC() methods to XYTransformerTestCase.java</li>
   </ul>
  </s2>
 </s1>

 <s1 title="Other tests">
  <ul>
    <li>
      Some Anteater Functional Tests at <code>src/test/anteater</code>
    </li>
    <li>
      <link href="../catalog-test.html">Testing: Catalog Entity Resolver</link>
      which conducts some additional tests for resolving external entities.
    </li>
  </ul>
 </s1>
