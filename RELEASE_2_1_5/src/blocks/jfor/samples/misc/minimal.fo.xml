<!-- example for a simple fo file. At the beginning the page layout is set. 
  Below fo:root there is always 
- a single fo:layout-master-set which defines one or more page layouts
- an optional fo:declarations 
- and a sequence of one or more fo:page-sequences containing the text and formatting instructions 
-->

            If you see this in an RTF document, it means it was successfully converted from xsl:fo to RTF.
            If converted by jfor, a document property called jforVersion tells you the version of jfor used for conversion
