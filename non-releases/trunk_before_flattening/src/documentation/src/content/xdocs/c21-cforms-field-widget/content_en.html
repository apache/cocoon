<h1>Concept</h1>
      
<p>The field widget is the most common widget. It is used both for
      text boxes or selection lists. It can be associated with different
      datatypes such as string, long or date to ask for different types of data.</p>

      
<div align="center">

<h2>Datatypes</h2>
<p>A datatype represents a certain type of data, such as a
        string, integer, decimal or date. Each datatype matches to a certain
        Java class. If you associate a field widget with a datatype, its
        setValue(Object) and getValue() methods will take, respectively
        return objects that are instances of that Java class (or subclasses
        thereof).</p>
<p>Each datatype is associated with a <strong>convertor</strong>.
        The task of the convertor is to convert from string representation
        to object representation, and vice versa.</p>
<p>The string to object conversion usually happens when converting
        the value entered by the user to an object. This process can
        fail if the user entered an incorrect string, for example
        <span class="codefrag">abc</span> when a number is required. In this case
        an appropriate validation error will be set on the widget.
        String to object conversion also happens when parsing data
        in selection lists (if the selection list is retrieved as XML)
        and can also be used as part of the <a href="binding.html">binding</a>.</p>
<p>The object to string conversion happens when the state
        of the widget is spit out as XML, this is mostly when injecting
        the widget XML in the publishing pipeline.</p>
<p>By having a field widget associated with a datatype, you can be sure
        that, after successful validation of the widget, retrieving the value
        of the widget will give you an object of the correct type.</p>
<p>The available datatypes and their respective convertors are
        documented in a <a href="datatypes.html">separate document</a>.</p>

      
<h2>Selection lists</h2>
<p>A field widget can furthermore be associated with a selection list.
        This makes that the field widget could be rendered either as a textbox
        or a list, depending on whether its datatype has a selection list.
        The selection list is related with the datatype: the values in
        the selection list should be of the same type as the datatype.</p>
<p>Selection list data can be specified directly in the form definition
        (for short, unchanging lists), retrieved from external sources (i.e.
        a Cocoon pipeline), or pulled from an oject structure. Full details on
        selection lists are also in a <a href="datatypes.html">separate document</a>.</p>

      
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If we wouldn't make these datatype and selection list associations,
        we would need to create specific widgets for each possible combination:
        StringField, LongField, DateField, StringSelectionList, LongSelectionList, ...</p>
    

    
<h1>Configuration</h1>
      
<p>Configuration example:</p>

      
<pre class="code">&lt;fd:field id="..." required="true|false"&gt;
  &lt;fd:label&gt;...&lt;/fd:label&gt;
  &lt;fd:hint&gt;...&lt;/fd:hint&gt;
  &lt;fd:help&gt;...&lt;/fd:help&gt;
  &lt;fd:datatype base="..."&gt;
     [...]
  &lt;/fd:datatype&gt;
  &lt;fd:selection-list .../&gt;
  &lt;fd:validation&gt;
     [...]
  &lt;/fd:validation&gt;
  &lt;fd:on-value-changed&gt;
     [...]
  &lt;/fd:on-value-changed&gt;
&lt;/fd:field&gt;</pre>

      
<p>The field element takes a required <strong>id</strong> attribute.
      This id should be unique among all widgets in the same container (i.e. inside
      the same fd:widgets element).</p>

      
<p>The <strong>required</strong> attribute is optional, by default it is false.
      It indicates whether this field is required. This is a static property of the
      widget. If you want the field to be "conditionally required", then set this
      to false and use custom validation logic to check the requiredness of the field.</p>

      
<p>The <strong>fd:label</strong> element contains the label for this widget.
      This element is optional. It can contain mixed content. For internationalised
      labels, use i18n-tags in combination with Cocoon's I18nTransformer.</p>

      
<p>The <strong>fd:hint</strong> element contains a hint for the form control of this widget.
      This element is optional. It can contain a hint about the input control.
      For internationalised labels, use i18n-tags in combination with Cocoon's I18nTransformer.</p>

      
<p>The <strong>fd:help</strong> element contains more help for the form control of this widget.
      This element is optional. It can contain text help about the input control.
      For internationalised labels, use i18n-tags in combination with Cocoon's I18nTransformer.</p>

      
<p>The <strong>fd:datatype</strong> element indicates the datatype for
      this field. This element is required. The base attribute specifies
      on which built-in type this datatype should be based. The contents
      of the fd:datatype element can contain further configuration
      information for the datatype. The possible datatypes and their
      configuration options are described <a href="datatypes.html">over here</a>.</p>

      
<p>The <strong>fd:selection-list</strong> element is used to associate
      a selection list with this field. See <a href="datatypes.html">Datatypes</a>
      for more details.</p>

      
<p>The <strong>fd:validation</strong> element specifies widget validators.
      See <a href="validation.html">Validation</a> for more details.</p>

      
<p>The <strong>fd:on-value-changed</strong> element specifies event
      handlers to be executed in case the value of this field changes.
      See also <a href="eventhandling.html">Event Handling</a>. The interface to be implemented
      for Java event listeners is <span class="codefrag">org.apache.cocoon.forms.event.ValueChangedListener</span>.
      The WidgetEvent subclass is <span class="codefrag">org.apache.cocoon.forms.event.ValueChangedEvent</span>.</p>

      
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> Events used in &lt;fd:on-value-changed&gt;
      require that the form instance is stored serverside (because otherwise
      CForms doesn't know what the previous values of the fields were).
      This is automatically the case when you use flowscript. If you don't use
      flowscript you could store the form instance in e.g. the session.</p>
