<h1>Overview</h1>
            
<p>
                This How-To shows you how to run and explore the Cocoon samples. It requires no
                prior knowledge of Cocoon.
            </p>
        

        
<h1>Purpose</h1>
            
<p>
                You will learn how install and run Cocoon in the simplest way, in order to run the Cocoon samples, and
                also how to study the samples from the inside to see how their are built.
            </p>
        

        
<h1>Intended Audience</h1>
            
<p>
                Beginning Cocoon users or people evaluating Cocoon for the first time.
            </p>
        

        
<h1>Prerequisites</h1>
            
<p>You only need a JDK (1.3 or later) installed on your computer, and an Internet connection
                to download Cocoon.</p>

        

        
<h1>Steps</h1>
            
<p>
                Here's how to proceed.
            </p>

            
<h2>1. Get Cocoon</h2>
<p>
                    Download Cocoon from the location listed on the
                    <a class="external" href="http://cocoon.apache.org">cocoon.apache.org</a>
                    web site.
                </p>
<div class="note">
                    If you want the latest bleeding edge version, you can get it from CVS, this is described on
                    the site as well, but more complicated if you're not familiar with CVS.
                </div>

            
<h2>2. Build and start Cocoon</h2>
<p>
                    Unpack the Cocoon distribution and follow the instructions found in the
                    <em>INSTALL.txt</em> file to build
                    Cocoon.
                </p>
<div class="note">
                    If you have done this previously, make sure to remove any local.* configuration files that you
                    might have created. You usually want to activate all Cocoon components to look at the samples,
                    and local.* files might disable some components or even disable the samples.
                </div>
<div class="note">
                    Also, if you have already built Cocoon with a different configuration before, you might need to
                    do a "build clean" first, to prevent any conflicts between different configurations.

                </div>
<p>
                    The INSTALL.txt file also contains instructions for starting Cocoon with the <em>cocoon.sh</em> or
                    <em>cocoon.bat</em> script, which is the simplest way and is sufficient to explore the samples.
                </p>

            
<h2>3. Access the samples</h2>
<p>
                    Once Cocoon starts (and assuming you have kept the standard configuration), point your browser
                    at http://localhost:8888, this should show the "Welcome to Apache Cocoon" page. On this page,
                    click the
                    <em>samples</em> link.
                </p>
<p>
                    You should now see a page with links to many samples (
                    <em>Hello World!</em>, etc.), which show you what Cocoon is about.
                    Note that there are several categories of samples: do not forget to look at the
                    <em>blocks
                        with samples</em> page, which contains samples based on components which are not part of the Cocoon core.
                </p>
<p>
                    Another category is the
                    <em>scratchpad</em> samples , these are based on experimental
                    components that might or might not be included later in the Cocoon core or in a Cocoon block.
                </p>

            
<h2>4. Study the samples</h2>
<p>
                    Now comes the interesting part: looking at the samples innards to find out how they are built.
                </p>
<p>
                    This is fairly simple as the directory structure of the samples is similar to the URLs
                    used to access the samples. These simple rules should help you find out much more about
                    the samples:
                </p>
<ul>
                        
<li>If using the standard build configuration, samples are found under the
                            <em>build/webapp/samples</em> directory. That's where you want to look
                            to find out how a particular sample works.
                        </li>
                        
<li>Under this directory, the pathnames are the same than after the
                            <em>http://localhost:8888/samples</em> base URL. The
                            midi block samples, for example, are accessed from
                            <em>http://localhost:8888/samples/midi</em>
                            and the corresponding files are found under
                            <em>build/webapp/samples/midi</em>.
                        </li>
                        
<li>
                            When studying how a sample is built, it is recommended to first study its <em>sitemap.xmap</em>
                            files, which map incoming requests to pipelines.
                        </li>
                    
</ul>
        

        
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
            
<p>
                We hope that this How-To will help you explore the samples yourself, as this
                is probably the best way of learning about Cocoon.
            </p>
            
<p>
                Do not forget to look at the reference documentation though, once you have found
                out which Cocoon components you need for your application.
            </p>
