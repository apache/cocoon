<h1>Concept</h1>
      
<p>The same "ft:" tags as provided by the <a href="templatetransformer.html">template
      transformer</a> are also available as macros for the
      <a href="../flow/jxtemplate.html">JXTemplate</a> generator.</p>

      
<p>Before the availability of these macros, the JXTemplate generator was
      already often used in the form publishing pipeline. It makes it possible
      to dynamically include additional data on the form page and to conditionally
      include parts of the page (and thus conditionally show widgets).
      Moving the interpretation of the <span class="codefrag">ft:</span> tags directly into
      generator makes this even more powerful. Think of the possibility
      of not showing a repeater table if the repeater contains no rows,
      and this also for nested repeaters.</p>
    

    
<h1>Usage</h1>
      
<p>Simply remove the FormsTemplateTransformer from your publishing pipeline,
      and instead include the following jx statement into your template file:</p>

      
<pre class="code">&lt;jx:import uri="resource://org/apache/cocoon/forms/generation/template.jx"/&gt;</pre>

      
<p>Note that these macros only work when calling the pipeline from flowscript.</p>
