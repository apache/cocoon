<h1>Introduction</h1>
    
<p>
    Publishing dynamic content or creating web-applications 
    eventually involves database access. Apache Cocoon
    offers a number of different approaches to access
    (object) relational and XML databases. This document provides
    an overview of the different ways to access (object)
    relational databases.
    </p>
    
<p>
    This document will not explain how to set up database
    connectivity with Apache Cocoon. For this, see <a href="../../developing/datasources.html">here.</a>
    
</p>
    
<p>
    Basically, there are three different approaches available:
    <a href="actions.html">Actions,</a> <a href="../xsp/logicsheet-concepts.html">logicsheets,</a>
    and <a href="sitemap.html">transformers.</a> Each approach has
    its pros and cons. 
    </p>
  

  
<h1>Actions Approach</h1>
    
<p>
    
<a href="actions.html">Actions</a> are code to be executed
    during pipeline setup. The outcome of an action can change how a pipeline is
    assembled. For example, a pipeline may produce an alternative
    page to display upon failure of a particular database operation.
    </p>
    
<p>
    Actions are especially great for inserting, changing, or deleting data. 
    Employing the pipeline-switching features of actions will simplify your 
    pages. Such actions are concerned with only one view: either the success
    or failure of an operation.
    </p>
    
<p>
    Actions can be useful, even when data is not provided by users.
    For example, you could store tracking information in a database in
    a central location without the need to modify every page.
    </p>
    
<p>
    Database actions can read and return data from a database. This is
    useful when the pipeline assembly depends upon such data. It's also
    useful when setting up an environment for XSP processing.
    </p>
    
<p>
    Once the database meta data is captured in an XML descriptor file, 
    making use of these actions is simply a matter of placing them in a pipeline. 
    This is a major advantage of the action approach. No programming is
    required, not even SQL query writing.
    </p>

<h1>ESQL Logicsheet Approach</h1>
    
<p>
    The use of logicsheets is limited to XSPs. ESQL is currently available
    for Java-based XSPs. Its interface is modeled largely on
    JDBC. Thus, it is advantageous to be familiar with JDBC.
    </p>
    
<p>
    ESQL is great when reading data from a database. However, it is less attractive
    to use when it has to react to operation failures. This is due to the fact
    that it adds a layer of complexity to an XSP file, making it
    more difficult to understand and maintain.
    </p>
    
<p>
    Complex layouts of the data are easy to achieve. ESQL allows
    the arbitrary nesting of queries and connections. It also provides support for
    stored procedures and complex data types. ESQL provides a means to 
    create a structured representation of the database data with a single tag. 
    This is useful when generating reports to use
    with other XML-aware software or to be formated with XSL or CSS2.
    XML data can be retrieved from the
    database and included in the output. With some supported database
    management systems, ESQL supports skipping part of the
    resultset as well as limiting the result. 
    Given the full power of Java available within XSP,
    any processing of the data is possible. 
    </p>

    </p>
  

  
<h1>SQL Transformer Approach</h1>
    
<p>
    An approach using the SQL transformer can be combined with any kind
    of page. This will result in slightly cleaner pages as you don't need
    some of the setup that an ESQL approach requires.
    </p>
    
<p>
    On the other hand, it is more or less impossible to react to operation
    failures. This is due to the fact that the pipeline is already assembled 
    and the necessary logic to handle such failures is not
    available inside the SQL transformer, unless of course, you are willing
    to write a custom transformer.
    Thus, the transformer approach is best for retrieving data. Creating
    an XML representation of the query result is even simpler than when
    using the ESQL logicsheet. The transformer also supports stored procedures.
    No programming is required, apart from writing SQL.
