<h1>Overview</h1>
 
<p>
  The Cocoon samples are now under <span class="codefrag">src/webapp/samples/</span> and have
  been refactored to be self contained, to have their own sitemaps, and to
  utilise some common resources.
 </p>

 
<p>
  However, there are still some old samples that have not yet been moved into
  this new structure. They are at <span class="codefrag">src/webapp/docs/samples/</span> and so
  are not available from the samples page. Please help to bring them back.
 </p>

 
<p>
  The main page of the samples is becoming rather cluttered again. The aim
  is to have various samples pages, rather than just one big page.
 </p>

 
<p>There are some missing groups of samples, e.g.</p>


<ul>

<li>Welcome =&gt; Samples =&gt; More Samples =&gt; Static Content</li>

<li>Welcome =&gt; Samples =&gt; More Samples =&gt; Server Pages</li>

<li>Welcome =&gt; Samples =&gt; More Samples =&gt; Sources</li>

<li>Welcome =&gt; Samples =&gt; More Samples =&gt; Web Applications</li>

</ul>
 

 
<h1>Procedure</h1>


<ul>

<li>Choose your favourite missing sample.</li>

<li>Create a new directory under <span class="codefrag">webapp/samples</span>
</li>

<li>Follow the example of some other samples,
e.g. <span class="codefrag">poi/</span> or <span class="codefrag">i18n/</span> or <span class="codefrag">misc/</span>
</li>

<li>
<span class="codefrag">cp samples/misc/sitemap.xmap samples/yours/sitemap.xmap</span>
and edit it to suit your own matches.
</li>

<li>
<span class="codefrag">cp samples/misc/samples.xml samples/yours/samples.xml</span>
and edit it to become the front page to your collection of samples.</li>

<li>Move the documents from the old sample at <span class="codefrag">webapp/docs/samples</span>
</li>

<li>Make links to your new samples from other pages.</li>

<li>Remove the old sample from <span class="codefrag">webapp/docs/samples</span>
</li>

<li>Ensure that the new sample works as expected.</li>

<li>Send a <a href="../howto/index.html">patch via Bugzilla</a>
</li>

</ul>
