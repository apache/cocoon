  <h1>Catalog Entity Resolver</h1>
  <p>
    A component that uses entity catalogs for resolving external entities.
    It sets the entity resolver onto the hook provided by the SAX parser,
    and then handles the resolveEntity() requests.
  </p>
  <p>
    This implementation uses the XML Entity and URI Resolvers
