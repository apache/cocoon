<p>Output modules provide a simple interface to set values largely based
on the methods provided by request and session to set values of attributes.
Output modules should support transactional behaviour. Transaction begin
is implicit with the first setAttribute method call. Transactions must be
terminated either by commit or rollback.&nbsp;</p>
