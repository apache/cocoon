 
 What is left to do?
 -------------------

Tons of stuff, but here is a list of the things that I think are most important 
at the moment:

 - write different rendering stylesheets for mozilla or IE since IE is *really* 
   poor at CSS2 compatibility. Why? well, again, 90% of the browsers are IE and 
   this is going to take a while to change.
 
 - allow the ability to write essays and not only news and while you do this, 
   considering adding pagination capabilities, also at the editing level (for 
   example, a button that can trigger the presence of a tag that indicates page 
   break)
 
 - improve the ability to redeploy linotype without having to hardwire URLs 
   around the sitemap and flowscript. (probably goes along with 
 
 - consider adding the ability to sinchronize two different linotypes. 
   For example, if you have one installed in your laptop and you are offline 
   for a while, you might want to synchronize it with the one online.

 - multi-user setup to host multiple weblogs or weblogs authored by multiple 
   authors.
