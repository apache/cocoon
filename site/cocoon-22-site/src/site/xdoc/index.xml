        <p>The main design goal of Apache Cocoon 2.2 was providing better support for
          modularization:

        </p>
        <p>Cocoon is based on the
          <a href="http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.0.x/reference/index.html">Spring
            2.0
          </a> framework. The Spring Configurator and the Servlet Service Framework are
          two subprojects having Spring as main dependency. It's important to note that
          both can be reused outside of Cocoon Core.
          <br/>
          The 
          <a href="../subprojects/configuration/index.html">Spring Configurator</a> provides basic support for
          configuring web applications that make use of Spring. The
          <a href="../subprojects/servlet-service/servlet-service-impl/index.html">Servlet Service Framework</a> enables modularization based
          on the 
          <tt>javax.servlet.Servlet</tt> interface. Those servlet services are
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_in_object-oriented_programming">polymorphic</a>.

        <p>
          <a href="../2.2/core-modules/1210_1_1.html">Cocoon Core</a> provides implementations of a sitemap
          engine and of pipelines. It also establishes a contract to add modules. The unit
          of modularization in Cocoon is called blocks. 
          <a href="../2.2/blocks/1204_1_1.html">This list</a>
          gives an overview of what additional functionality is available. Web
          applications based on Cocoon are also developed following the block contracts.
