itself - if you're looking for <em>using</em> Cocoon have a look at
<a href="2.2/1159_1_1.html">this document</a>.</div></div><h1>Get Cocoon 2.2 from trunk</h1><p>Do <tt>svn checkout http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/cocoon/trunk</tt> of
Cocoon trunk. Keep up-to-date because there is everyday improvement.</p><h1>Install Maven</h1><p>Need at least Maven-2.0.9 and follow the
<a href="http://maven.apache.org/download.html#installation">installation
instructions</a>. Ensure that <tt>mvn --version</tt> is okay.</p><p>If you are not familiar with Maven, It is highly recommended to read the
<a href="http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/index.html">Getting
Started</a> guide.</p><h1>Build Cocoon</h1><p>This will take some time, as Cocoon has lots of dependencies which will be
downloaded my Maven automatically. Go to the root directory of your working copy
of Cocoon and call</p><pre>mvn clean install</pre><p>This will build the core artifacts (sitemap, pipelines, blocks-fw, etc.) and
the most important blocks. If you want to build Cocoon completely, call</p><pre>mvn install -P allblocks
</pre><p>which activates the allblocks profile.</p><p>If you run into problems, check the page on solving
<a href="1164_1_1.html">common Maven2 problems</a>.</p><h1>Offline mode</h1><p>After your local repository is ready and Cocoon has been built, subsequent
builds can be executed in offline mode. Maven will look for dependencies or poms
only in your local repository. However, after doing 'svn update' you will need
to let Maven loose on the network again. When doing active development, it is a
good idea to add the "clean" goal to be sure that everything gets rebuilt.</p><pre>mvn -o ...</pre></div></div>
