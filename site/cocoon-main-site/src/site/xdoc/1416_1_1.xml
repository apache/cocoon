Cocoon. This relaunch comprises a new design for the main site and the Cocoon

2.2</a> with a</p><ul>
<li>small <a href="2.2/core-modules/core/2.2/1270_1_1.html">core</a></li>
<li>which is based on the <a href="subprojects/">subprojects</a>
"<a href="subprojects/configuration/">Cocoon Configuration</a>" and
"<a href="subprojects/servlet-service/servlet-service-impl/">Cocoon Servlet-Service Framework</a>"</li>
<li><a href="2.2/blocks/1204_1_1.html">blocks</a> with additional functionality (e.g. PDF or
SVG creation, form frameworks, etc.)</li>
<li>and <a href="2.2/maven-plugins/1208_1_1.html">Maven 2 plugins</a>.</li>
</ul>The content was also cleaned up so that information which had become
irrelevant for 2.2 was removed, though this is a still ongoing process.<br/>
