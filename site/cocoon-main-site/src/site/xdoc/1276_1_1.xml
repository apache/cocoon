in several roles:</p><ul>
<li>For <strong>Cocoon users</strong>: as the downloader for getting the
artifacts that constitute the Cocoon binary distributions. These artifacts
include:
<ul>
<li>Cocoon jars</li>
<li>Dependent jars</li>
<li>Configuration files</li>
</ul>
This method is superior to other alternatives, e.g. downloading tarballs,
manually downloading transitively dependent artifacts, etc.</li>
<li>Also for <strong>Cocoon users</strong>: optionally, as the deployer/launcher
for Cocoon, e.g. to run in an instance of the Jetty servlet container (details).
</li>
<li>For Cocoon <strong><em>application</em> developers</strong> building web
apps using Cocoon + custom Java code: it's recommended that you set up your
projects to use Maven as your build tool.  This frees you from having to deal
with all the usual low-level build infrastructure issues of classpaths, jar
dependencies and versions, etc. and lets you get on with the coding!</li>
<li>For <strong>Cocoon developers</strong>: as the build tool for
<a href="798_1_1.html">building Cocoon</a> (all, or parts of) from the source
code.  You are a Cocoon developer if you are working on a patch or other source
code submission.  <strong><em>Note</em></strong>: Cocoon users / application
developers should never need to build Cocoon from the source code.  It should be
sufficient to specify Cocoon artifacts in your project's Maven
<a href="http://maven.apache.org/pom.html#What%20is%20the%20POM?">POM</a>, which
you can set up initially <a href="2.2/1159_1_1.html">using a Maven archetype</a>.</li>
</ul><div class="note"><div><strong>Note: </strong>Maven 2.0.6 or greater is required for all of these tasks.</div></div><section name="Eclipse" style="background:none;padding:0;"/>A lot of Cocoon developers like to use the
<a href="http://eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> IDE, so the Cocoon build sets up
<a href="1214_1_1.html">Cocoon as an Eclipse project</a>.  However, you don't have
to use Eclipse to develop with or on Cocoon.  You can get by with nothing but a
text editor and Maven.<section name="Jira" style="background:none;padding:0;"/><img width="111" height="30" name="jira_logo_small" alt="jira_logo_small" src="images/1320_1_1.img"/>The Cocoon project uses Atlassian JIRA for bug/issue tracking.  Anyone can
<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COCOON">browse the issues</a>. 
Anyone can create or comment on an issue too, you just have to
<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/Signup!default.jspa">create a
login</a> on Apache's JIRA first.<section name="Continuum" style="background:none;padding:0;"/><img width="76" height="32" name="continuum" alt="continuum" src="images/1321_1_1.img"/>The Cocoon project uses Maven
<a href="http://maven.apache.org/continuum/">Continuum</a> to run its
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_Integration">continuous
integration</a> build cycle. This probably isn't all that interesting except to
the Cocoon committers. For the rest of us, we can just feel happy about the fact
that Cocoon is being integrated... continuously... :-)</div></div>
