of Apache Cocoon.</p><p>Apache Cocoon is a web development framework built around the concept<br/>
of separation of concerns (that is: allowing people to do their job<br/>
without having to step on each other toes) and component-oriented web<br/>
RAD.</p><p>The latest version is downloadable from<br/>
<a href="http://cocoon.apache.org/mirror.cgi">http://cocoon.apache.org/mirror.cgi</a>
<br/>
(Please use the mirrors to download the release - it might take<br/>
a little bit more time until the latest release is available on<br/>
all mirrors, so give the mirrors some time - approx. 24h to update.)</p><p>This release includes many bug fixes and smaller enhancements.</p><p>For more information about Apache Cocoon 2.1.10, please go to<br/>
