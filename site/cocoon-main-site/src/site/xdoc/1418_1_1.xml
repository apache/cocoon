         <div id="contentBody"><div id="bodyText"><h1 class="docTitle">How to publish docs to cocoon.apache.org</h1><p>If you want to publish the Cocoon docs you can follow one of those two paths:
</p><ul>
<li>use the nightly build on cocoon.zones.apache.org</li>
<li>build the docs at your local machine</li>
</ul><h1>Use the nightly build</h1>There is a nightly build (runs at 2am and 2pm UTC) of our docs available at
cocoon.zones.apache.org. Login via ssh and use the 'maven' user:<pre>sudo su - maven</pre>Then change to<pre>cd ~/svn-site-generation</pre><p>There you will find a directory <tt>svn-docs</tt>. It contains a recent
checkout (= part of the nightly docs build) and the result of the docs
generation process copied over. If you want to see the docs online, point your
browser to
<a href="http://cocoon.zones.apache.org/nightly-docs/">http://cocoon.zones.apache.org/nightly-docs/</a>.
</p><div class="note"><div><strong>Note: </strong>There is a second job which builds the docs once a day too. In
addition to the first one it adds a couple of reports (Findbugs, SVN reports,
etc.). See
<a href="http://cocoon.zones.apache.org/dev-docs/">http://cocoon.zones.apache.org/dev-docs/</a>.
</div></div><p>Using</p><pre>svn st svn-docs</pre><p>will show you all the differences.</p><p>If you want to add all the newly generated docs run</p><pre>svn st | grep "\?" | awk '{print $2}' | xargs svn add
</pre><p>which will recursivly add all new documents.</p><p>Then run</p><pre>svn ci [path] --no-auth-cache --username [username]</pre><p>for all the docs that you want to publish.</p><p>That's it. When the docs are committed to the SVN, they will be published
within the next 60 minutes.</p><h1>Build the docs locally</h1><p>Actually it's the same as using the nightly build. The only difference is
that you have to build the docs yourself. The <a href="1256_1_1.html">How to build
the docs locally guide</a> explains how you can doÂ  this. Then follow the steps
from above.</p></div></div>
