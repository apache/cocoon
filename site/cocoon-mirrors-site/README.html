<p><b>NOTE:</b> Starting with 2.1 we only
release a <b>source distribution</b>. This issue was discussed on
the developer list. Using this source distribution is really easy and
avoids most of the common pitfalls of the binary distribution.
See further <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/cocoon/LatestRelease">explanation</a>.</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> Cocoon includes all the packages required to run out of the
box (included Xerces, Xalan and FOP) so you don't need to download
anything else to start. </p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> For earlier versions of Cocoon (which did have binary distributions).
Due to the incompatibilities between JDK 1.3 and JDK 1.4,
you have to choose between a binary version targetted for JDK 1.2/1.3
and a version specially targetted for JDK 1.4 (
Using a build targetted for one JVM on a different JVM may result in
runtime errors). Now you see why a source release is easier for everyone.</p>
