  <b>NOTE:</b>
  Cocoon includes all the packages required to run out of the
  box (included Xerces, Xalan and FOP) so you don't need to
  download anything else to start.
</p>
<p> <b>NOTE:</b> For earlier versions of Cocoon (which did have binary
distributions). Due to the incompatibilities between JDK 1.3 and JDK 1.4,
you have to choose between a binary version targetted for JDK 1.2/1.3
and a version specially targetted for JDK 1.4 (Using a build targetted for
one JVM on a different JVM may result in runtime errors).</p> 
<p><b>NOTE:</b> See the main distribution page for
<a href="../">further information</a>.
