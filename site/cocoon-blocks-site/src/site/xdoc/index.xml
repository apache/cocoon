        <td>Cocoon has an advanced forms framework. Together with Flow and JXTemplates, Cocoon Forms (or CForms) provides a solid basis for 
            building interactive web applications. Cocoon Forms handles complex use cases while still being simple enough to be used by non-Java-programmers 
            who want to add forms to their site.</td>
