         <div id="contentBody"><div id="bodyText"><h1 class="docTitle">Logging configuration</h1><h1>Introduction</h1><p>Cocoon uses Log4j library for logging and uses it quite extensively so log
files can be very valuable source of information how things are performed. There
are five standard log levels to choose in order to limit amount of information
dumped to log files:</p><ul>
<li>FATAL_ERROR</li>
<li>ERROR</li>
<li>WARN</li>
<li>INFO</li>
<li>DEBUG</li>
</ul>In production environment it is reasonable to set a log level to
<tt>ERROR</tt> or <tt>FATAL_ERROR</tt> so only very important events are logged
(like crashes). While developing an application you would probably like to see
much more. It's up to you to choose an approporiate log level; little
experimantation will give you sense of each setting.<h1>Tweaking the configuration</h1>Configuration in Cocoon is handled by <a href="../../../../subprojects/configuration/spring-configurator/index.html">Spring
configurator</a>, go there for general information.<section name="How to set up a log level" style="background:none;padding:0;"/><div class="note"><div><strong>Note: </strong>Instructions put below assume that you have created a block
according to this <a href="../../../../2.2/1159_1_1.html">tutorial</a>. Please refer to it, first.
</div></div>Steps that you need to perform:<ol type="1">
<li>
create a <tt>properties</tt> subfolder in your block:

<pre>myBlock1/src/main/resources/META-INF/cocoon/properties</pre>
</li>
<li>
create a new file in that folder that should have as ending
<tt>.properties</tt>, e.g. <tt>settings.properties</tt>
</li>
<li>inside that file you have to put this line if you want to set log level to
<tt>DEBUG</tt>:<br/>

<pre>org.apache.cocoon.log4j.loglevel=debug</pre>
</li>
</ol>That's all! Restart your webapp and you should see now a detailed log
information in a file in:<pre>myBlock1/target/work/log/log4j.log</pre></div></div>
