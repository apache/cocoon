         <div id="contentBody"><div id="bodyText"><h1 class="docTitle">Creating a Serializer</h1><h1>Creating a Serializer</h1><p>For most problems, Cocoon has a serializer ready for you.  However, you may
have to deal with some new unique binary format which is fed by your XML.  The
SVG to PNG serializer works in this way as does the FOP to PDF serializer. 
Given that there are only so many ways to present data on the web, it is very
difficult to come up with an example serializer that is new and useful. 
Nevertheless we will present the <a href="http://www.yaml.org">YAML</a>
serializer.  There is no real direct mapping of concepts, but the only thing
that you can't map directly in YAML to XML is the attributes.</p></div></div>
