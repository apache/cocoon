        As with all the AbstractTextSerializer based serializers, the XHTMLSerializer should handle
        the omit-xml-declaration to not put the XML declaration as first line of the serialized
        document. This prevents many rendering problems in Internet Explorer. Default behaviour is
        to send the xml declaration as before.
