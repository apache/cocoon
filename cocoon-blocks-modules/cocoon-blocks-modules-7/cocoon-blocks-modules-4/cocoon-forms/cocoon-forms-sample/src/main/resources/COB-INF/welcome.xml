 <group name="Dynamic templates and recursive forms">
   <note>
     These samples were written for the GT2004 presentation about dynamic templates and recursive forms.
     They illustrate the use of "jx-macros.xml" to interpret form template elements within the generator,
     allowing the page layout to depend on the contents of the form, and the use of fd:union and fd:class
     widgets.
