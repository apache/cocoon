      Choose a file in Forms's samples. The suggestion-list is written in JavaScript
      (server side) and scans the samples directory with the input given.

      <ft:widget id="path" type="suggest"/>
      <small>To view suggestions, you can either start typing, hit the down arrow on your keyboard
      or click on the down arrow icon. To choose a suggestion, select it with the mouse, or
      use the up/down arrow and press space. Hitting escape hides the suggestion list.</small>
