        <para>Hi there! I'm a very complex dynamic page generated by XSP
          (eXtensible Server Pages), with source dynamically generated by XSP.
          Nobody should use such complex constructs while in good health :)</para>
        <para>
          My source resides in the file <b>COB-INF/sources/content/dynamic.xsp</b>.

        <para>
          My source was generated by XSP at <b><xsp:expr>new Date()</xsp:expr></b>.
        </para>
        <para>
          I know that I was requested as the URI <b> <an-xsp-request:get-uri as="xml"/></b>,
          and executed at <b><an-xsp:expr>new Date()</an-xsp:expr></b>
          by <b><an-xsp:expr>Constants.COMPLETE_NAME</an-xsp:expr></b>.
