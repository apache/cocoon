    </para>

    <para>
      Here we take the key 'language' from the default (= messages) catalogue:
      <i18n:text>language</i18n:text>.
    </para>

    <para>
      Here we take the key 'Documentation' from the menu catalogue:
      <i18n:text i18n:catalogue="menu">Documentation</i18n:text>.
    </para>
  </content>
