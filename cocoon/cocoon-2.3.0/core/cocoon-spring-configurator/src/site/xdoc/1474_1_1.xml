         <div id="contentBody"><div id="bodyText"><h1 class="docTitle">Migration</h1><h1>Migration from 1.0 to 2.0</h1><p>Version 1.0 of the Spring-Configurator incudes functionality to unpack Cocoon
Blocks at runtime and make them usable with the block-context: protocol. Since
this feature is Cocoon specific, it was moved into a newly created
<a href="../../../../../subprojects/block-deployment/index.html">Cocoon Block-Deployment</a> module. This module has to be
added to your application if you want to retain the same functionality.</p></div></div>
