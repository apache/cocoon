unpacks all blocks into the temp directory of the current servlet context. A
block is recognized if it has an entry <tt>Cocoon-Block-Name</tt> in its
manifest file.</p><p>The <a href="http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-jar-plugin/">Maven Jar
plugin</a> or the
<a href="http://ant.apache.org/manual/CoreTasks/manifest.html">Ant Task
'manifest'</a> allow the manipulation of manifest file.</p><p>The class<tt>
org.apache.cocoon.blockdeployment.BlockContextURLConnection</tt> provides access
to the deployed blocks and can be used to resolve <tt>block-context: </tt>URLs.
