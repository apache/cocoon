         <div id="contentBody"><div id="bodyText"><h1 class="docTitle">Component Configurations</h1><p>While older versions of Cocoon used one single big file for the configuration
of components (the cocoon.xconf), the later versions support to split this
configuration file into several files using an include mechanism. You can refer
to properties from within your configuration files and Cocoon will replace these
accordingly.</p><h1>Spring Configuration</h1><p>Spring configurations are supported through the <a href="../../../../subprojects/configuration/spring-configurator/index.html">Spring
Configurator</a>. Have a look at the <a href="../../../../subprojects/configuration/spring-configurator/index.html">documentation</a> for
more information.</p><h1>Legacy Configuration</h1><p>Although Cocoon is moving away from the Avalon framework (which is of course
still supported for compatibility), still the main part of Cocoon is configured
by using the Avalon configuration file format. By default all configuration
files ending with ".xconf" which are contained in the WEB-INF/cocoon/xconf
directory are included. So, you can just add your own configuration files there
and they are included automatically. The name of the configuration file is
required to end with ".xconf". The files are read in alphabetical order. </p><h1>Sitemap Configuration</h1><p>You can use per sitemap components using includes as well. By default all
Avalon based configuration files from "config/xconf" and all Spring bean
configuration files from "config/spring" are included.</p></div></div>
