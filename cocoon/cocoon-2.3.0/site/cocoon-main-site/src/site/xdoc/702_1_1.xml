only, so we still don't actually know how much traffic it will handle in the
future.</p><h5>What made you choose Cocoon to build the site?</h5><ol type="1">
<li>Separation of concerns</li>
<li>Ability to generate, from a single dynamically generated XML file, as many
formats as needed (HTML, PDF, and so on).</li>

Finally the cocoon part was the easiest one ;-)</p><h5>How many people were involved in the project?</h5><p>2 but representing a child companies accross Europe (it will be extend in a
near futur to center in France, Germany, Italy,...) ==&gt; Content management
(under Notes &amp; DB2) via Web and publication via Cocoon.</p><h5>How much traffic does this site handle?</h5><p>Actually 3000 pages/ hour.</p><h5>What made you choose Cocoon to build the site?</h5><p>Has to separate concerns as for MVC ==&gt; I want a site that can be build on
any behind databases and a content management that do not care about the
presentation ==&gt; use XML as exchange tunnel and represent saved data with
Cocoon.</p><h5>What other information do you want to disclose (e.g. how does it work, how
did you build it, what parts of Cocoon did you use)?</h5><p>I bind it with Lotus Notes with my own generator. It's also coupled with DB2
with ESQL. The site contains also forms that I link with Lotus Notes databases.
</p><p>I run it under Jetty ==&gt; that's really a nice web server that perform
exactly what we asked and only that, really easy to configure,...<br/>
I also include a features that I think must be include in all web site : Filter
: Zip filter greatly improve performance of site if well managed. Perhaps an
idea for the next Cocoon release</p><section name="EFIX PULS" style="background:none;padding:0;"/><p><em>Date added: 2005-09-10</em></p><p>Information vortal for polish forex traders</p><p><strong>URL:</strong>
