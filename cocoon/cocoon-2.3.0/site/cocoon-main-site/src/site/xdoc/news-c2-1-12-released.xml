  The Apache Cocoon Community is proud to announce the new release of Apache Cocoon.

  Apache Cocoon is a web development framework built around the concept of separation of concerns
  (that is: allowing people to do their job without having to step on each other toes)
  and component-oriented web RAD.  

  The latest version is downloadable from <a href="http://cocoon.apache.org/mirror.cgi">http://cocoon.apache.org/mirror.cgi</a>

  (Please use the mirrors to download the release - it might take a little bit more time until
  the latest release is available on all mirrors, so give the mirrors some time - approx. 24h
  to update.)

  This release includes many bug fixes and smaller enhancements.

  For more information about Apache Cocoon 2.1.12, please go to <a href="http://cocoon.apache.org">http://cocoon.apache.org</a>.
  You'll find the whole list of changes at <a href="http://cocoon.apache.org/2.1/changes.html">http://cocoon.apache.org/2.1/changes.html</a>.
