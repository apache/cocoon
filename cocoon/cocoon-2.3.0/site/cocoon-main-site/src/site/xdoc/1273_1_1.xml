	<h1 class="docTitle">How to contribute?</h1>

	<p>The Apache Cocoonâ„¢ project is actively seeking new contributors to work on all aspects of the project. We need and appreciate all contributions, including documentation help, source code development and feedback.</p>

	<h2>Code</h2>
	<ul>
	  <li>When you have found an issue or you want to propose a new feature, post a message to Cocoon User's list to discuss it.</li>
	  <li>Search existing <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa" rel="nofollow">issues</a> to see whether someone had already encountered the same issue.</li>
	  <li>If this issue is never encountered before, create a JIRA issue for Cocoon <a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COCOON">2.1/2.2</a> or <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COCOON3">3.0</a>.</li>
	  <li>Develop a test case to demonstrate the issue.</li>
	  <li>Attach the new test to JIRA issue.</li>
	  <li>If you have also developed a fix for the raised issue, attach a patch to it. Here are some useful <a href="https://commons.apache.org/patches.html">guidelines</a> about how to correctly generate a patch.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Documentation</h2>
	<p>The website is managed via the <a href="http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-site-plugin/">maven-site-plugin</a>, hence contributing site content is very close to contributing source code: create a new issue on JIRA and attach there a SVN patch. See <a href="1256_1_1.html">this page</a> for more information.</p>
	<p>The project <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/cocoon/">wiki</a> is also there to gather any other kind of documentation or contribution you would like to contribute, and does not require any SVN, Maven or other technical skills.</p>

	<h2>Quick references</h2>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    Discussion occurs on the <a href="mail-lists.html">Cocoon mailing lists</a>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Information on access to the project source code is available for Cocoon <a href="798_1_1.html">2.2</a> and <a href="3.0/source-repository.html">3.0</a>.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Bugs and other issues can be posted on the Cocoon <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COCOON">2.1/2.2</a> and <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COCOON3">3.0</a> JIRA
	  </li>
	</ul>

	<h1>How do I become a contributor or a committer?</h1>
	<p>Everyone can contribute to Cocoon as a contributor; contributors who	build up a history of successful contributions over time are invited to become committers. The difference is that committers have direct write access to the project SVN repositories, while contributors post their contributions to JIRA issues where they're first reviewed, and then committed by a committer to the project's SVN repository. See <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/contributors.html">http://www.apache.org/dev/contributors.html</a> for a good overview of working as a contributor.</p>
	<p>We ask contributors of significant amounts of code to fill out and send into Apache, an <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas">Individual Contributors License Agreement (ICLA)</a> (and perhaps also a <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas">Corporate Contributors License Agreement (CCLA)</a>).</p>
	<p>If you're interested in committing to the project, you need to establish a history over time of successful contributions to the project. After that, you can be invited to become a committer.</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    You'll need to fill out some legal paperwork and go through a process to get an apache committer account: See <a class="external" rel="nofollow" href="http://apache.org/dev/new-committers-guide.html"> New Committers Guide</a>, <a class="external" rel="nofollow" href="http://apache.org/dev/contributors.html"> Contributors</a>, and <a class="external" rel="nofollow" href="http://apache.org/dev/committers.html"> Committers</a> for more details.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    After you've received an email from <a href="mailto:root@apache.org">root@apache.org</a> with your committer account information, change your initial password at <a href="https://id.apache.org">Apache Account Utility</a>. For more details see <a class="external" rel="nofollow" href="http://apache.org/dev/version-control.html">Committer Subversion Access</a>.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Check out the Cocoon sources and test your svn account: <a href="http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/cocoon">Subversion Repository</a>.
	  </li>
	</ul>
	<p>All Contributors and Committers should</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Sign up for a <a class="external" rel="nofollow" href="http://wiki.apache.org/cocoon/FrontPage?action=newaccount">WiKi</a> account.</li>
	  <li>Sign up for an <a class="external" rel="nofollow" href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/">ASF JIRA</a> account.</li>
	</ul>
