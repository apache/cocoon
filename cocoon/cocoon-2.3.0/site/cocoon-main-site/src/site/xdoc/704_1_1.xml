concerns. The Web designer was able to develop the style sheet totally
independent of the application logic. All business logic could be encapsulated
in services and tested with Junit outside the web container. At least the flow
provide as facility to bind the web application together. As a bonus we easily
can create Order documents in pdf. <br/>
Beside the fact that Cocoon is cool framework one of our partners used Cocoon in
former project.</p><h5>What other information do you want to disclose (e.g. how does it work, how

<strong>Contact</strong>: osnbeheer AT gmail.com</p><h4>Additional information</h4><h5>How much time did it take to build the site from design to publication?</h5><p>3 months, 1 person in spare time.</p><h5>How many people were involved in the project?</h5><p>1</p><h5>How much traffic does this site handle?</h5><p>+/- 6000 hits/day</p><h5>What made you choose Cocoon to build the site?</h5><p>Several reasons:</p><ul>
<li>I already knew how to use Cocoon from a different project</li>
<li>I didn't manage to tweak a preinstalled PHP-based CMS to do what I wanted in
a short amount of time</li>
<li>I have complete control over all aspects of the website</li>
</ul><h5>What other information do you want to disclose (e.g. how does it work, how
did you build it, what parts of Cocoon did you use)?</h5>The site contains a search engine for folding models that were published in
the OSN's magazines Orison and Minori. This search engine uses an XMLRPC query
call to an externally running eXist database.<br/>
Currently the pages are almost all XML files (i.e. for each page an XML file
with content in both languages exists), there are plans to move to a
(Cocoon-based) CMS to allow others to update the site.<br/>
It uses CForms + flowscript for all forms.<section name="Other sites" style="background:none;padding:0;"/><ul>
