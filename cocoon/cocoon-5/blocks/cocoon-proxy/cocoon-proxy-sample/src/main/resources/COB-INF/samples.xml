    <sample name="Simple Hello World sample" href="wsproxy/">
      Demonstrates how to embed one website's functionality into another.
      Using the WebServiceProxyGenerator remote web app integration is easy.
      This sample only links the Hello World XML and transforms it to HTML,
      which is rather trivial, but with having a look into the sitemap it should
      give you the idea.

    <sample name="Virtual Portal Demo" href="cocoonhive/">
      A more sophisticated example including Amazon and OpenWiki.
      Shows how a personalized portal can be built by connecting multiple remote
      services without writing a single line of business logic code.
      Only styling is used in addition to the proxy.
