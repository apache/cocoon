This is a dummy file provided to avoid Maven archetype plugin's limitation.

Archetype plugin does not create empty directory structure:
"At this point one can only specify individual files to be created but not empty directories."
(http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-archetype-plugin/examples/archetype.html)

You can safely remove this file at any time.
