     Apache Documentation DTD (Version 1.1)

PURPOSE:
  This DTD was developed to create a simple yet powerful document
  type for software documentation for use with the Apache projects.
  It is an XML-compliant DTD and it's maintained by the Apache XML
  project. It has now been superceded by v1.2.

TYPICAL INVOCATION:

  <!DOCTYPE document PUBLIC
       "-//APACHE//DTD Documentation V1.1//EN"
       "document-v11.dtd">

  where

    x := major version
    y := minor version

NOTES:
  Many of the design patterns used in this DTD were take from the
  W3C XML Specification DTD edited by Eve Maler <elm@arbortext.com>.

  Where possible, great care has been used to reuse HTML tag
  names to reduce learning efforts and to allow HTML editors to be
  used for complex authorings like tables and lists.

EXTENSIBILITY:
  This DTD includes several empty placeholders that can be used to
  extend it. These placeholders are implemented with empty entities. Here
  is the list of those empty entities and what they are used for:

    - local.inline: this entity should contain extended definitions of
                    elements that can be used 'inline', or directly inside
                    the content. An example for this entity could be

                        <!ENTITY % local.inline "|citation">

    - local.blocks: this entity should contain extended definitions of
                    elements that behave as 'blocks', thus can be visually
                    rendered as areas on the canvas. An example for this
                    entity could be:

                        <!ENTITY % local.blocks "|poem">

    - local.sections: this entity should contain extended definitions of
                      elements that behave as 'sections', thus can be considered
                      containers of block-level elements. An example for
                      this entity could be:

                        <!ENTITY % local.sections "|chapter">

    - local.headers: this entity should contain extended definitions of
                     elements that behave as parts of the document header.
                     An example for this header could be:

                        <!ENTITY % local.headers ", notes?">

    - local.footers: this entity should contain extended definitions of
                     elements that behave as parts of the document footer.
                     An example for this header could be:

                        <!ENTITY % local.footers ", annotations*">

FIXME:
  - should "form" tags be included?
