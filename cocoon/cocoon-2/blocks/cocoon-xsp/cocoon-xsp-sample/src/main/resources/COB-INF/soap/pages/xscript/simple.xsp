    <content>
      <para>
        This is a simple XSP page demonstrating how to work with
        inline XScript variables. This example show how one can create
        and later refer to an XScript variable.
      </para>

      <xscript:variable name="my-var">
        <b>123</b>
      </xscript:variable>

      <para>
        The content of the XScript variable is: <xscript:get name="my-var"/>.
      </para>

      <para>
        We now remove the Xscript variable "my-var", and try to access
        it again. You should see an error message indicating it's no
        longer available.
      </para>

      <para>
        <xscript:remove name="my-var"/>
        <xscript:get name="my-var"/>
