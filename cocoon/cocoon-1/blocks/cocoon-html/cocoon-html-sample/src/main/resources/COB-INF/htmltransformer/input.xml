<html-transformer-test>
  <div id="explain">
    <p>
      This XML file contains HTML code with escaped markup: tags are written
      like &amp;lt;body/&amp;gt; with escaped &lt; and &gt; signs. This is
      often the case with RSS feeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this example, the HTMLTransformer is configured to parse the contents
      of the &lt;description&gt; and &lt;escaped-html&gt;, elements, creating
      well-formed content from this escaped markup.
    </p>
    <p>
      A downstream transform is used to filter the result, as the HTMLTransformer
      writes full HTML documents as &lt;html&gt; elements, for each input element
      that it parses.
    </p>
    <p>
      For more info search "HTMLTransformer" in the sitemap that drives this sample.

    <div id="example-1">
      <description>
        <!-- this element does not contain markup, only text with escaped &lt; and &gt; signs -->
        &lt;div style="background: #FFFFCC; color: black; margin: 1em;"&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Here's some escaped HTML&lt;/h1&gt;
        This test document contains escaped HTML code in the description elements,
        as is customary in RSS documents for example.
        &lt;p&gt;

        &lt;img align="right" src="http://cocoon.apache.org/2.1/images/cocoon.gif"/&gt;

        This description element contains escaped html markup, which should be
        converted to proper html by the HTMLTransformer. If the Cocoon logo is shown
        properly, it means that the parsing worked.
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
        This should be a blockquote and &lt;b&gt;here's some bold&lt;/b&gt;.
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        Note that the HTMLTransformer generates a complete HTML document for each element that
        is parsed - here this is filtered downstream to keep only the contents of the &amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
        of the parsed documents.
        &lt;/div&gt;
      </description>
    </div>

    <div id="example-2">
      <escaped-html>
        &lt;div style="background: #FFFFCC; color: black; margin: 1em;"&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;More escaped HTML&lt;/h1&gt;

         &lt;img align="right" src="http://cocoon.apache.org/2.1/images/cocoon.gif"/&gt;

         Another description element with escaped html markup, including a Cocoon logo.
         &lt;p&gt;
         Here's some &lt;i&gt;italic&lt;/i&gt; and a &lt;a href="http://cocoon.apache.org"&gt;
         link to the Cocoon site&lt;/a&gt;.

         &lt;/div&gt;
