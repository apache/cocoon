    <release version="1.0.0" date="2008-00-00" description="unreleased">
      <action dev="gkossakowski" type="fix" issue="COCOON-2150">
        Fixed bug in ServletServiceContext that was responsible for errors on resetting response that was already committed.
        Now Servlet Service Framework buffers response but only if 404 status code has been set.
        This allows to reset the response safely.
      </action>
      <action dev="gkossakowski" type="update">
        Made attributes 'mount-path' and 'context-path' of servlet-context tag required.
      </action>
      <action dev="reinhard" type="add">
        The "+" character is not allowed at the end of connection names anymore. Starting
        Cocoon will fail hard with a RuntimeException if this rule is broken. See
        org.apache.cocoon.servletservice.spring.ServletDecorator.
      </action>
      <action dev="reinhard" type="add" issue="COCOON-2154">

      </action>
      <action dev="reinhard" type="add" issue="COCOON-1831">
        The ServletServiceResponse inherits the request attributes, request parameters and the session
        from the caller.
      </action>
      <action dev="gkossakowski" type="add" issue="COCOON-2036" due-to="Alexander Klimetschek" due-to-email="alexander.klimetschek@googlemail.com">
        Throw an exception when circular dependencies in servlet connections are detected.
      </action>
      <action dev="gkossakowski" type="fix">
      	DispatcherServlet does not throw an exception if it fails to find suitable servlet for processing incomming request.
      	It returns 404 error and puts information to log about the failure, instead.
      </action>
    </release>
