/**
 * Selects the first of a set of Resources (usually files) that exists in the
 * context.
 * <p>
 * The 'test' expression is interpreted as a context-rooted ('/' = context)
 * path, resolved by the servlet container, <em>not</em> a Source.
 * <p>
 * A parameter, 
 * <pre>
 * &lt;map:parameter src="prefix" value="<code>/</code>"/>
 * </pre>
 * may be supplied to the selector instance.  This prefix is prepended to all
 * test expressions before evaluation.  The default prefix is '<code>/</code>',
 * meaning that all expressions are context root-relative, unless explicitly
 * overridden.
 * <p>
 * For example, we could define a ResourceExistsSelector with:
 * <pre>
 * &lt;map:selector name="resource-exists"
 *               logger="sitemap.selector.resource-exists"
 *               src="org.apache.cocoon.selection.ResourceExistsSelector" />
 * </pre>
 * And use it to build a PDF from XSL:FO or a higher-level XML format with:
 *
 * <pre>
 *  &lt;map:match pattern="**.pdf">
 *    &lt;map:select type="resource-exists">
 *       &lt;map:when test="context/xdocs/{1}.fo">
 *          &lt;map:generate src="content/xdocs/{1}.fo" />
 *       &lt;/map:when>
 *       &lt;map:otherwise>
 *         &lt;map:generate src="content/xdocs/{1}.xml" />
 *         &lt;map:transform src="stylesheets/document2fo.xsl" />
 *       &lt;/map:otherwise>
 *    &lt;/map:select>
 *    &lt;map:serialize type="fo2pdf" />
 * </pre>
