/**
 * Components implementing this marker interface have a lifecycle of one
 * request. This means if during one request a component accepting this
 * interface is looked up several times, it's always the same instance.
 * Each internal subrequest, e.g. using the cocoon protocol, is considered
 * as a new request. So an instance looked up in the "main" request is
 * not available to a subrequest.
 * In addition, the first time this component is looked up during a request,
 * the {@link #setup(SourceResolver, Map)} method is called.
