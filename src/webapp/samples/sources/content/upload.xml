      Hi there! I'm a simple static page read from a file, but that's not the 
      interesting part of this sample.  Select any xml file from your local 
      drive, and upload it.  The resulting page will display that xml transformed 
      by a stylesheet (which could also be provided via upload).

      You must have configured enable-uploads as true in web.xml or built Cocoon 
      with the config.enable-uploads=true property set for this sample to work.

    	<form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data" action="xml-upload-post" >
    	File:  <input type="file" name="formFieldOne" size="50" />
         <p>
           <input type="submit" value="Upload File" />
