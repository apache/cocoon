   </sample>
   <sample name="User Preferences" href="pref/">
    A common portion of an application which requires users to be
	registered. This example shows how to use java objects from the 
	javascript flow as it is best practice to put business logic into
	strongly-typed java objects and use javascript to describe only the
	page flow.
