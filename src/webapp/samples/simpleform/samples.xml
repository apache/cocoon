  <group name="Simple Form Handling">
     <note>
       This samples group demonstrates the use for the simple form handling
       in Apache Cocoon. Simple form handling consists of four parts:
       validating user input, filling forms with submitted data, displaying 
       validation results, and filling forms with default values. This
       corresponds largely to the involved Cocoon components: a validating
       action, a logicsheet helping to display validation results, a
       transformer to fill in submitted data and display validation results,
       and a transformer to extract default values.
     </note>
     <note>
       Apache Cocoon contains several approaches to forms. The one demonstrated
       here is probably the simplest but also the weakest. Please do consider
       the others as well: JXForms and Woody.

     <sample name="Logicsheet" href="one/index">
       On a XSP two logicsheets are used to redisplay submitted data and
       indicate validation results.
     </sample>
     <sample name="One Transformer" href="two/index">
       On a static XML page a form is displayed, submitted data is filled in,
       and validation results are displayed by the use of the
       SimpleFormTransformer.
     </sample>
     <sample name="Default Values" href="three/index">
       On a static XML page, form elements are separated from the default
       values. The SimpleFormInstanceTransformer is used to extract the data
       and the SimpleFormTransformer is used to pre-fill the form. No
       validation is performed.

       This sample combines the two samples above into one.
