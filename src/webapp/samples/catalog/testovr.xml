<para>&note; This paragraph is automatically included from the
 testovr.xml external file.
 The location of this entity was not resolved by the catalog, because
 there is no matching catalog entry for its public identifier or its
 system identifier. So the declared system identifier is used,
 i.e. the file is retrieved relative to the top-level document.
