    <title>Serialized entities test</title>
    <content>
        <para>
            Test how the XML serializer manages startEntity() and endEntity() SAX events. The XML serializer
            only ouputs the characters events received between these two events, and totally ignores the
            startElement() and endElement() events.
            <ul>
                <li>
                  <link href="file-xml">Bogus result</link>: a pipeline with just a file generator followed by
                  an XML serializer. The file references and entity containing XML markup.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <link href="file-xsl-xml">Correct result</link>: a XSL performing an identity transformation
                  is inserted between the generator and the serializer. It has the effect of removing the
                  startEntity() and endEntity() events from the SAX stream, and the XML serializer therefore
                  correcly does its job.
