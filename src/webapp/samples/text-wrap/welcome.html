<h1>Various methods to handle long lines of text</h1>

<p>
Sometimes the lines inside &lt;source&gt; elements are too wide,
which can make the resulting pages too wide to view on screen or to print.
The width of the long source line causes the whole page layout to be that
same width. A web page that is wider than the screen is a complete bastard to
read - you have to scroll right and left all the time. And printing in 
landscape orientation is not very nice either.
(See Bugzilla report
<a href="http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=23796">23796</a>.)
</p>

<p>
We need to find a way to consistently split lines that are too wide.
Here are demonstrations of various solutions. Each one has pros and cons.
Please help to enhance these solutions so that one can soon be implemented.
(See <a href="#notes">Notes</a> below.)
</p>

<p>
Of course, there is the workaround solution to edit the offending source
elements to specifically break long lines. Not good for automated solutions
or separation of concerns.
</p>

<p>
The following examples are deliberately extreme to ensure that the issues
are triggered.
</p>
                                                                            
<h2>Using no special handling</h2>
<p>No special handling was done for the
&lt;source&gt; elements. The content is wrapped with a &lt;pre&gt; element.
Note the long right-left scrollbar.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="raw/with-word-boundaries">Long Line With Word Boundaries</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="raw/without-word-boundaries">Long Line Without Word Boundaries</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="raw/cdata-model">CDATA and deeply embedded xml content model</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="raw/cdata-model-2">CDATA and deeply embedded xml content model with long names</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="raw/ascii-art">Ascii Art</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Using the "split.xsl" stylesheet</h2>
<p>All &lt;source&gt; elements had their long
lines split by the included split.xsl stylesheet.
The content is wrapped with a &lt;pre&gt; element.
</p>
<p>Note: In past Cocoons this stylesheet has been reported to be a memory hog on certain Java JDKs. How does it go for you?
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="split/with-word-boundaries">Long Line With Word Boundaries</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="split/without-word-boundaries">Long Line Without Word Boundaries</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="split/cdata-model">CDATA and deeply embedded xml content model</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="split/cdata-model-2">CDATA and deeply embedded xml content model with long names</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="split/ascii-art">Ascii Art</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Using the "wrap2para.xsl" stylesheet</h2>
<p>Only &lt;source&gt; elements that did not
contain an xml content model, had their long
lines handled by the included wrap2para.xsl stylesheet.
Such lines are each wrapped with a styled &lt;p&gt; element.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="wrap2para/with-word-boundaries">Long Line With Word Boundaries</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="wrap2para/without-word-boundaries">Long Line Without Word Boundaries</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="wrap2para/cdata-model">CDATA and deeply embedded xml content model</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="wrap2para/cdata-model-2">CDATA and deeply embedded xml content model with long names</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="wrap2para/ascii-art">Ascii Art</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Other notes</h2>
<p>
Suggested enhancements include: using the @type attribute; "content sniff"; ...
</p>

<p>
There may be some other solutions. Suggestions include the Chaperon Block
and maybe the Slop Block.
