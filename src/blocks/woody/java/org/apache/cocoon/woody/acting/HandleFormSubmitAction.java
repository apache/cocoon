 * An action that will create a form instance, let it handle the current request (and

 * validation failed. In both cases, the created form instance is stored in a request attribute,

 *
 * <p>Required parameters:
 * <ul>
 *  <li><strong>form-definition</strong>: filename (URL) pointing to the form definition file
 *  <li><strong>attribute-name</strong>: name of the request attribute in which the form instance should be stored
