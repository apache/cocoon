    <note>
      NOTE: All these samples operate on the filesystem by default. Each sitemap has a global
      variable {staging} that is empty. Just put your content on a WebDAV server (i.e. copy
      this folder to your WebDAV server) and point this variable to the corresponding
      path. The WebDAV protocol is then used transparently. Now you can connect one or several
      additional Cocoon instances to your WebDAV repository to serve as publishing engines.
    </note>
    <note>
      In fact you could use any of Cocoon's pseudo protocols that implements the TraversableSource and
      ModifiableSource interfaces.

      Putting meta data separate. This sample puts the meta data in a separate file with
      a .meta extension. You could equally well put your meta data in a relational database
      by putting the SQLTransformer in the write pipeline and modifying the doc2write.xsl
      stylesheet accordingly. That way you can query your meta data via SQL later on. In the
      future there will be the possibility to store your meta data together with your document
      as a WebDAV property and query it via DASL (given you have a DASL enabled WebDAV server
      such as Catacomb)

      This sample shows how to serve WebDAV clients from Cocoon
      (i.e. using Cocoon as a WebDAV server) - still some work
      in progress, but quite usable already: point your favourite
      WebDAV client to [Cocoon URL]/samples/webdav/davmap/repo/ and
      have fun browsing around!

    <sample name="DASL query" href="dasl/">
      This sample shows how to run a query against a DASL 
      enabled WebDAV server (such as Catacomb or Slide). It assumes that
      on localhost a DASL enables server is running with a resource 
      path of /repos (the default place for Catacomb installs). If
      that's not the case, please change dasl/test.dasl.xml accordingly.
