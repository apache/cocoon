/**
 * The ElementProcessor interface defines behavior for classes that
 * can handle a particular XML element's content.
 * <br>
 * The life cycle of an ElementProcessor instance is:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>Creation
 *     <li>Initialization via a call to initialize
 *     <li>Acquisition of element data via calls to acceptCharacters
 *         and acceptWhitespaceCharacters
 *     <li>Completion of processing via a call to endProcessing
 * </ol>
 * In response to a startElement event, the POIFSSerializer creates an
 * ElementProcessor, delegating the act of creation to an
 * ElementProcessorFactory, and then initializes the
 * ElementProcessor. In response to subsequent characters and
 * ignorableWhitespace events, the POIFSSerializer will pass data to
 * the ElementProcessor via the acceptCharacters or
 * acceptWhitespaceCharacters methods. Finally, in response to an
 * endElement event, the POIFSSerializer calls the ElementProcessor's
 * endProcessing method.
