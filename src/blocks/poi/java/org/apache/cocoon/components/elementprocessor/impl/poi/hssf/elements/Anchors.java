/**
 * Anchors. This particular object is represented in gnumeric's XML as
 * four integers, space separated. Presumably, each represents an
 * anchor for a particular direction -- top, bottom, left, right --
 * but what the reference is for each anchor is not known, nor is it
 * known which one is top, bottom, left, or right, or even whether
 * that's the correct interpretation of the numbers. This is an area
 * of the gnumeric XML that is not terribly well documented even in
 * their code, and I don't think the features that use anchors are
 * terribly mature yet.
