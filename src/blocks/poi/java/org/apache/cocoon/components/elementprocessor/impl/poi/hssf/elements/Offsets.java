/**
 * Offsets. This particular object is represented in gnumeric's XML as
 * four doubles, space separated. Presumably, each represents an
 * offset in a particular direction -- top, bottom, left, right -- but
 * what the reference is for each offset is not known, nor is it known
 * which one is top, bottom, left, or right, or even whether that's
 * the correct interpretation of the numbers. This is an area of the
 * gnumeric XML that is not terribly well documented even in their
 * code, and I don't think the features that use offsets are terribly
 * mature yet.
