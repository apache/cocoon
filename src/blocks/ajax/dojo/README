Tools to make a build of Dojo 1.1.1

Currently Cocoon Forms defaults to accessing Dojo from Google CDN.
If you would either like to serve a local Dojo, or you'd like to setup your own CDN, 
you will need to build Dojo.

This process is very easy :

1. Downlaod a source release of Dojo :
    eg. $ wget http://download.dojotoolkit.org/release-1.1.1/dojo-release-1.1.1-src.zip
    
2. Unpack the release
    eg. $ unzip dojo-release-1.1.1-src.zip
    
3. Build the full set of locales in Dojo, to give you full formatting support in CForms
    run the Ant build script in dojo release util/buildscripts/cldr/build.xml
    
4. Setup the build script in this directory
    copy 'build.properties' to 'local.build.properties'
    edit the 'dojo.home' property to the location of your dojo release directory

5. Run the build script in this directory
    $ ant

6. Install the resulting Jar file in Cocoon
