<!-- Example binding to bind the "form2" form to the bean "Form2Bean" -->

<!-- The id attributes on the elements in this file map to widgets in the
     form definition. The path attributes are JXPath expressions addressing
     properties of the bean. -->

<!-- It would be an interesting exercise to generate this file from
     javadoc-tags in the bean using an xdoclet-like approach. -->
