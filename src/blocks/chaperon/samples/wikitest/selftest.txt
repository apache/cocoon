This wiki document is a self-describing test of the Cocoon Chaperon wiki grammar. Reading what follows 
should tell you if the tests are successful.

The page http://wiki.cocoondev.org/Wiki.jsp?page=ChaperonTestPage should be kept in sync with this so as
to be able to compare the output of both, as the Chaperon wiki grammar is meant to emulate the JSPWiki syntax
used by the Cocoon wiki.
