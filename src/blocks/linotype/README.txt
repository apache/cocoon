 What is this?
 -------------
 
Linotypes were machines that first allowed a single individual to mass-produce content without sacrificing typesetting elegance and text readability. Blogs turned the web into writeable media without sacrificing the ability to remain hypertextual. This is simply an attempt to combine the two concepts together.

 Requirements
 ------------

Linotype just depends on Cocoon and saves its edited content on disk, nothing else.

Thanks for your interest in Linotype.
