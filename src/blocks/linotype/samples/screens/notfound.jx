<h1>Page Not Found</h1>
<div class="block">
  <p>I'm terribly sorry, but I can't find the page you have requested.</p>
  <p>I sware to god, I looked for it! Really. You can't even imagine the 
  millions of calculations that I had to go thru to look in all places
  where my owner could have left it. But I couldn't find it :-(</p>
  <p>No, it's not your fault, it's all my own. I'm a bad server. I know that. Terrible.
  I should get a new job one day or another, but what else can I do?</p>
  <p>Look: the only thing I can suggest you is to go to the 
  <a href="#{base}/">home page</a> and look for the page you wanted from there.
  I can guarantee you I know where that one is :-)</p>
