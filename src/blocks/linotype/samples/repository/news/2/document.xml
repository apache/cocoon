Linotype</n:title><body
xmlns:h="http://apache.org/cocoon/request/2.0">First of all, make sure
that file upload is enabled on web.xml.<br/>
<br/>
Then click on the linotype here on the left.<br/>
<br/>
When the login appears, use:<br/>
<ul><li>user -&gt; guest</li>
<li>password -&gt; guest</li>
</ul>

at that point, you are presented with the list of available news and a link to create a new one. Click on that, edit and enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
Ah, hint, try the image inserting feature. After you have inserted the image, if you drag your mouse over it, you resize it. Isn't it cool? :-)</body></n:news>
