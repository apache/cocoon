    <!-- Sets the path to the directory where cache .data files are created.

         If the path is a Java System Property it is replaced by
         its value in the running VM.

         The following properties are translated:
         user.home - User's home directory
         user.dir - User's current working directory
         java.io.tmpdir - Default temp file path -->
    <diskStore path="java.io.tmpdir"/>


    <!--Default Cache configuration. These will applied to caches programmatically created through
        the CacheManager.

        The following attributes are required for defaultCache:

        maxInMemory       - Sets the maximum number of objects that will be created in memory
        eternal           - Sets whether elements are eternal. If eternal,  timeouts are ignored and the element
                            is never expired.
        timeToIdleSeconds - Sets the time to idle for an element before it expires. Is only used
                            if the element is not eternal.
        timeToLiveSeconds - Sets the time to idle for an element before it expires. Is only used
                            if the element is not eternal.
        overflowToDisk    - Sets whether elements can overflow to disk when the in-memory cache
                            has reached the maxInMemory limit.
