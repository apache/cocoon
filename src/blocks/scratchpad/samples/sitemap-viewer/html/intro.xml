    This is a Sitemap-viewer, made by Jelle Alten.
</p>
<p>
    This viewer reads a sitemap, attempts to follow links, references and other interesting lines in the &apos;match&apos; elements and generates an HTML file from this information. If you use IE or Mozilla, the resulting HTML has clickable buttons for folding and unfolding elements. 
</p>
<p>
    <b>Warning: This tool can show the contents of sitemaps, don't put this tool in a production environment for security reasons.</b>
    The source-viewing is turned on and off in the sitemap, in the "showsources" parameter and by setting the internal-only attribute of the "srcviewing"-pipeline.
</p>
<p>See this <a href="example.html">example of a difficult sitemap</a> to see where it won't work.</p>
<p>
    It is in a testing stage, and some work, cleanup and documentation should still be done. It works fine on Cocoon 2.1.2+
