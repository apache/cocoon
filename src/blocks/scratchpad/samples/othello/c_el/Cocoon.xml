		<p class="paratitle">Apache Cocoon</p>
		<p>Apache Cocoon is a web development framework built around the concepts of separation of concerns and component-based web development.</p>
		<p>Cocoon implements these concepts around the notion of 'component pipelines', each component on the pipeline specializing on a particular operation. This makes it possible to use a Lego(tm)-like approach in building web solutions, hooking together components into pipelines without any required programming.</p>
		<p>Cocoon is "web glue for your web application development needs". It is a glue that keeps concerns separate and allows parallel evolution of all aspects of a web application, improving development pace and reducing the chance of conflicts.</p>
		<p class="paratitle">The Apache Cocoon Project</p>
		<p>The Apache Cocoon Project is the open source community project developing Apache Cocoon and Cocoon-based application frameworks. With strong foundations in XML-based server-side web application frameworks, the Apache Cocoon Project consists of a group of people that share common values on collaboration-intensive and community-based quality open source development. The Apache Cocoon Project is proud to share these values with its parent organization: The Apache Software Foundation.</p>
		<p>The Apache Cocoon project currently consists of:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Apache Cocoon itself.</li>
			<li>xQueries</li>
			<li>Lenya, an incubating website content management framework based on Cocoon. </li>
		</ul>
