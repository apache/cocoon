        <note>
            As of August 6, 2003 the SlopGenerator (Simple Line Oriented Parser)
            is functional but somewhat limited.
            RFC822 parsing does not properly take continuation lines
            (like "by..." after Received-From) into account, and a specific
            rfc822 mode should be implemented to avoid parsing the message body.
            On the other hand, the code is very simple and thus should be quite fast.
