A (short) journey through the (few) YAPT features.

slide: What is YAPT?
hint-style: LotsOfText

Yet Another Presentation Tool.

The idea is to make it super-easy to create decent-looking presentations, for display or printing.

A presentation consists of a single structured (wiki-like) ASCII file, with some simple rules:

* The first line must contain "presentation:" (without quotes) followed by the presentation title.

* Each slide starts with a "slide:" line.

* Empty lines separate paragraphs. There must be an empty line between the slide: line and the slide text.

* For images, use a single line starting with img_XXXX: where XXX is the CSS class
name to use. See yapt-images.css for available classes.

* A "presentation" page containing all slides is available for printing.

* Presentations are converted in XML on the way.

That's it. There are more details and examples in the following slides, and you can have a look a the yapt-demo.txt
file from which this presentation is created.

slide: Navigation
hint-style: LittleText

Click anywhere on a slide to go to the next one.

Use the grey links at the bottom of the page to go to the previous slide, or to the index.

note: This page uses a hint-style line to indicate that it contains little text and can use a larger font

slide: Image examples: half-left image

img_leftHalf: screenshot.jpg
Here's a example with an image. Try zooming or resizing your browser to presentation sizes to see how the display
behaves, the image must stay on the left and take half the width of the screen or page.

If you add text here it comes as a new paragraph.


slide: Image examples: half-right image

img_rightHalf: screenshot.jpg
Here's about the same thing, only with the image on the right.

subtitle: A subtitle
At this size, we'd only add a small legend here.


slide: Image examples: two images at 33%

img_leftThird: screenshot.jpg
Let's try with images on both the left and right sizes, how does this behave at
different zoom settings?

img_rightThird: tree.gif
subtitle: Flow!
When resizing, the text should flow freely between images.

slide: Conclusions

I'll try to use this tool for actual presentations in the near future, so it
will certainly get some improvements.

Missing features include:

* Real bulleted lists (but according to some they are evil;-)

* Code sections (monospaced fonts etc)

* Presentation wizard to automatically generate complicated flashy layouts with lots of stupid
transitions. Just kidding.
