  <group name="What is the MIDI block?">
    <note>The MIDI block currently gives you a component (the XMidiGenerator)
    to generate an XML representation from any MIDI file (called XMidi by its
    author Peter Loeb). There is also a component (the XMidiSerializer) to
    render XMidi back as a MIDI file. In due course I will add some
    transformers to perform basic musical manipulations such as transposition,
    inversion and retrograde. Hopefully I shall also add some transformers to
    generate SVG visualisations of the XMidi, starting with normal western
    musical notation.</note>

    ditty I wrote on the notes you get if you take the letters of the word
    "Cocoon" (using A=A, B=B, ... G=G, H=A, I=B etc.) You get C-A-C-A-A-G: very
    catchy.</sample>

    source code in the generator and serializer. This code, and the XMidi
    format itself were created by Peter Loeb. Many thanks to Peter for
    permission to use his source code.</sample>
