    <note>The MIDI block currently gives you a component to generate an XML
    representation from any MIDI file (called XMidi by its author Peter Loeb).
    In due course I will add a MIDI serializer and some transformers to
    generate SVG visualisations of the XMidi, starting with normal western
    musical notation. For fun, I shall also create some transformers to perform
    basic musical manipulations such as inversion and retrograde.</note>

    <sample name="A Short MIDI File" href="cocoon.mid">This is a little ditty I
    wrote on the notes you get if you take the letters of the word "Cocoon"
    (using A=A, B=B, ... G=G, H=A, I=B etc.) You get C-A-C-A-A-G: very
    catchy.</sample>

    <sample name="A Longer MIDI File" href="prelude.mid">Bach's Prelude No.1 in
    C, BWV846a , sequenced by B.R.Guillaud and available from The Classical

    <sample name="The MIDIGenerator" href="prelude.xmi">The above file rendered
    as XMidi, using the MIDIGenerator. Be warned, your browser may take some
    time to render the XML. As the emperor of Austria supposedly said to
    Mozart, "Too many notes!"</sample>
