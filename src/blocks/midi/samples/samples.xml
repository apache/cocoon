  <group name="What is the MIDI block?">
    <note>The MIDI block currently gives you an XMidiGenerator to generate an
    XML representation of any MIDI file (called XMidi by its author Peter
    Loeb). There is also the XMidiSerializer to render XMidi back as a MIDI
    file. I have used XSLT to provide some basic musical manipulations such as
    transposition, and inversion. Retrograde is harder, but I shall see what I
    can come up with. Hopefully I shall also add some transformers to generate
    SVG visualisations of the XMidi, starting with normal western musical
    notation.</note>
