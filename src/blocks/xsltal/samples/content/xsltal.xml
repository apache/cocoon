    <h1>What is XSLTAL</h1>
    <p>
      XSLTAL is a partial reimplementation of the Zope TAL
      templating syntax, which requires only an XSLT
      processor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tal2xslt transform used internally to implement this
      was donated to Cocoon by Christian Stocker of bitflux.org, so that
      we can collaborate on maintaining this and spreading the
      word.
