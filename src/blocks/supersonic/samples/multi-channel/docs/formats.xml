            Through its many <em>Serializers</em>, Cocoon can transform
            XML data into many output formats, including, but not limited to:
            <ul>
                <li>XML (obviously)</li>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>PDF</li>
                <li>RTF</li>
                <li>HSSF (Excel's Horrible SpreadSheet Format)</li>
                <li>WAP/WML</li>
                <li>SVG</li>
                <li>PNG, JPEG</li>
                <li>OpenOffice Write, Draw and Calc formats</li>
                <li>ZIP archives</li>
                <li>MIDI files</li>
                <li>Flash animations</li>
                <li>Plain text</li>
                <li>VRML</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            We say <em>not limited to</em>, because we might have forgotten
            to list some,
            but also because it is fairly easy for a Java programmer to implement
            any output format by writing a new <em>Serializer</em> or extending
            an existing one.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <em>Hello world</em> samples of Cocoon give simple examples
            of how these formats are generated.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our simple example will let you input some text and create
            a PDF document out of it, using the PDFSerializer based on
            the Apache FOP project.
