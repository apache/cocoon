            As already mentioned, our Java beans are dead simple and not very robust.
            The "database" is simply held in memory, loaded with simulated data at startup.
        </p>

        <h2>Interfaces</h2>
        <p>
            Here's the interface of the DatabaseFacade class, which is used by our
            Flowscript code to "talk" to the java beans:
            <pre class="code">
/** access the Database */
public static DatabaseFacade getInstance();

/** get our list of tasks
 *  @return a List of TaskBean objects */
public List getTasks();

/** get a single TaskBean */
public TaskBean getTaskBeanById(int id) throws Exception;

/** get this object's version */
public String getVersion();
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            Here's the interface of the TaskBean class, our main "task" object. It is basically a Java Bean
            with one read-only and three read-write properties.
            <pre class="code">
public int getId();
public String getTaskName();
public void setTaskName(String m_taskName);
public String getAssignedTo();
public void setAssignedTo(String m_assignedTo);

/** @return a List of TaskCommentBean objects */
public List getComments();

/** @param c a List of TaskCommentBean objects */
public void setComments(List c);
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            Here's the TaskCommentBean interface:
            <pre class="code">
public int getId();
public Date getDate();
public void setDate(Date m_date);
public String getComment();
public void setComment(String m_comment);
            </pre>
        </p>

        <h2>Access from Flowscript</h2>
        <p>
            Here's a code excerpt showing how Flowscript code can access java classes.
        </p>
        <pre class="code">
var db = Packages.org.apache.cocoon.samples.supersonic.beans.DatabaseFacade.getInstance();
...
list = db.getTasks();
        </pre>
        <p>
            Simple enough. The "official" way of accessing java components in a Cocoon
            application would be to use the Avalon lookup mechanisms, but this wouldn't
            add much to our example so we took the easy way here.
