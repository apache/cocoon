        <h2>Architecture</h2>
        <p>
            Cocoon is written in java and based on the
            <a href="http://avalon.apache.org/">Apache Avalon</a> components framework.
        </p>
        <p>
            Modular <em>blocks</em> can be enabled by configuration when installing Cocoon,
            allowing you to have either a small and focused system, or a "kitchen sink" installation
            with all possible options.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many of Cocoon's <em>core components</em> and <em>blocks</em> reuse
            Open-Source libraries, many from other Apache projects and some from outside
            the Apache Software Foundation.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <em>caching subsystem</em> uses sophisticated yet very customizable caching
            algorithms to maximize performance. Although some components or blocks might use a
            lot of resources (for example when generating PDF documents or bitmapped images), the Cocoon
            core itself is very efficient and can be tuned to maximize performance under high
            loads.
        </p>

        <h2>Licensing</h2>
        <p>
            Cocoon is distributed under the fairly liberal <em>Apache Software Foundation License</em>,
            which allows it to be used in most any way provided due credit is given to the Foundation.
        </p>

        <h2>Community</h2>
        <p>
            The Cocoon project lives through its <em>contributors</em> and <em>committers</em>, a
            community which is recognized for being friendly and efficient. Discussions take
            place on the <em>mailing lists</em> and IRC channels, and conferences or informal mettings
            called <em>GetTogethers</em> happen in various places.
        </p>
        <p>
            The current team comprises more than 40 active committers, of which about 20
            are regularly active and contribute new components, bug fixes, tests and documentation.
        </p>
