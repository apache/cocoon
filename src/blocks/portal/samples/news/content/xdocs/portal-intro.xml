	 <s1 title="The Apache Cocoon Portal"> 
		<p>This is a demo of the Cocoon Portal Engine.</p>
        <p>The Cocoon portal page you currently view displays some so called
          <em>Coplets</em> (= Cocoon Portlets). Each coplet displays
          a select content.</p> 
        <p>The different tabs display/demonstrate different aspects of the portal.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The TabDemo1 shows a tab inside a tab, which is useful for structuring content.</li>
          <li>The TabDemo2 shows the same content as TabDemo2 but with just a different stylesheet for the tab.</li>
          <li>The Coplets tab show some more coplets. You need to also have the petstore example installed!</li>
        </ul>
        <note>THIS IS A SAMPLE PORTAL. It demonstrates several features of 
          the portal engine, so it's not optimized for production. Make sure 
          that if you use the portal for your own projects that you
          remove all unused stuff from the configuration! Every configured
          feature might have an impact on the performance.
