	 <s1 title="The Apache Cocoon Portal"> 
		<p>This is a demo of the Cocoon Portal Engine.</p>
        <p>The Cocoon portal page you currently view displays some so called
          <em>Coplets</em> (= Cocoon Portlets). Each coplet displays
          a different content.</p> 
        <p><strong>THIS IS A SAMPLE PORTAL!</strong></p>
        <p>It demonstrates several features of 
          the portal engine, so it's not optimized for production. Make sure 
          that if you use the portal for your own projects that you
          remove all unused stuff from the configuration! Every configured
          feature might have an impact on the performance.
        </p>
