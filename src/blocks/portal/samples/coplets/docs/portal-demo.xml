	 <section title="The Apache Cocoon Portal"> 
		<p>This is a demo of the Cocoon Portal Engine.</p>
        <p>The Cocoon portal page you currently view displays some so called
          <em>Coplets</em> (= Cocoon Portlets). Each coplet displays
          a different content.</p> 
        <p>The different tabs display/demonstrate different aspects of the portal.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The TabDemo1 shows a tab inside a tab, which is useful for structuring content.</li>
          <li>The TabDemo2 shows the same content as TabDemo2 but with just a different stylesheet for the tab.</li>
          <li>The Gallery tab shows some more coplets.</li>
          <li>The JSR-168 tab demonstrates the integration of Portlets (read more below).</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>THIS IS A SAMPLE PORTAL!</strong></p>
        <p>It demonstrates several features of 
          the portal engine, so it's not optimized for production. Make sure 
          that if you use the portal for your own projects that you
          remove all unused stuff from the configuration! Every configured
          feature might have an impact on the performance.
        </p>

     <section title="The JSR 168">
        <p>The Cocoon portal supports portlets conforming to the JSR 168. The JSR 168 tab contains 
           a sample using the testsuite from the <fork href="http://portals.apache.org/pluto">Pluto project</fork>.</p>
        <p>These samples only work if you follow these installation instructions:</p>
        <ul>
         <li>Get the Pluto project and install it into Tomcat (Test Pluto now).</li>
         <li>Install Cocoon as a web application in Tomcat and remove the Pluto webapp. Please note,
             that it is currently not possible to start Cocoon directly from a war file; it has 
             to be expanded.</li>
         <li>Remove the pluto-*.jar and the portlet-api-*.jar from the Cocoon WEB-INF/lib directory.</li>
         <li>Start Tomcat and run the Cocoon portal demo. You should now see two portlets.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The current implementation searches for portlets in all directories that are next to
         the Cocoon webapp directory. So, if you put Cocoon into the webapps directory of Tomcat,
         you should put your portlets there as well.</p>
