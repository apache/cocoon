====================================
  Using Jakarta Slide with Cocoon
====================================

1. Copy the Java Transaction API (JTA) jar into
   lib/local before building or to ./build/webapp/WEB-INF/lib 
   after building.

2. Enable the option 'enable-uploads' within 
   src/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml

3. Startup cocoon

4. Access the slide repository via Cocoon

 http://localhost:8888/samples/slide/

[OPTIONAL]

5. If you want an access via WebDAV uncomment the webdav servlet-mapping
   declaration in web.xml


6. Access WebDAV via MS WebFolders, Cadaver or whatever

 http://localhost:8888/webdav/

Have fun, Stephan Michels <stephan@apache.org>

Some things must be fixed:

* The links of directory browsing doesn't work properly, because of the
  servlet mapping.

* The support of the locking mechanism within the sources is in a alpha state.
