      | A SourceRefresher is a component that is used by the CachingSource protocol.
      | It is responsible for updating the cached contents of sources that are
      | registered with it by the protocol.
      |
      | The DelaySourceRefresher is an implementation that periodically updates the
      | sources. It recognizes the following parameters:
      | - 'write-interval' (0). The SourceRefresher can periodically persist its
      |   list of registered sources. This parameter specifies how often
      |   it should write this list to file. Specifying a value of 0 (the default)
      |   means that target configurations will not be persisted at all.
      | - 'write-file' (refresher-targets.xml). Specifying a different value
      |   than the default for this parameter only makes sense if you configure
      |   more than one DelayRefreshers. It represents the file name, relative to
      |   the cocoon working directory of the file the refresher writes its list
      |   of registered target configurations to.
