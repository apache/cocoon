  From efficiency reasons it might be better to split this class in
  two, one that represent attribute content that are strings and one
  for Character content that are handled as char arrays. Here the
  content is stored as a char array as there in most cases will be
  much more content in elements than in attributes, so it is better to
  avoid copying there.
