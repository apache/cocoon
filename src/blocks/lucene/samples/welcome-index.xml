      <h1>XML Search</h1>
      
      <p>
        Welcome to Cocoon XML Search. This page introduces Cocoon searching
        and offers the following samples:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Creating a Lucene index to enable searching
        </li>
        <li>Searching through a once created Lucene index using various means:
        </li>
        <li>Searching a Lucene index using <em>SearchGenerator</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Creating an Index</h2>
      <p>
        You must create a Lucene index first, before you can do the searching.
        You can create a Lucene index either by crawling, or by using
        LuceneIndexTransformer.
      </p>

      <h3>Creating Index By Crawling</h3>
      <p>
        Create an index by specifying a base url from which to start
        crawling (the indexer will follow the links to build its content).
        The base url should be 
        <a href="http://cocoon.apache.org/2.1/userdocs/concepts/views.html">cocoon-view</a>
        aware of content-labels
        <strong>links</strong>, and <strong>content</strong>.
        For example you might use the base URL 
        <code>http://localhost:8888/docs/index.html</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        This following page allows you to <a href="create">create</a> an
        index of all of Cocoon Sample pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        (There are many ways to add content to a Lucene index. 
        For an example of using the LuceneIndexTransformer, see the <a href="../querybean/">QueryBean</a> Sample).
      </p>

      <h2>Searching</h2>
      <p>
        If you have created a Lucene index, you can search the created index.
      </p>
      <h3>Searching Index</h3>
      <p>
        Enter a query and search the Lucene index that you have created
        - using the <a href="http://cocoon.apache.org/2.1/userdocs/search-generator.html">Search Generator</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <form action="findIt" method="get">
            <input type="text" name="queryString" size="20" value="lucene"/>
            <input type="submit" value="Search" />
        </form>
      </p>
      
      <h2>Internals</h2>
      <p>
        Cocoon XML search uses the
        <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/">Jakarta Lucene</a>
        indexing and search engine.
        The Cocoon documentation
        <a href="http://cocoon.apache.org/2.1/userdocs/concepts/xmlsearching.html">explains</a> how it is implemented within Cocoon. Look behind the scenes of this
        example to find out more.
