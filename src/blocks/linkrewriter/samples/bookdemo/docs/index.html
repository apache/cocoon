    <h1>LinkRewriter demo</h1>
    <h2>/index.html</h2>

    <p>This subsitemap demonstrates the LinkRewriterTransformer, which rewrites
    links with the aid of configurable InputModules</p>
    <p>This particular demo is set up so that links of the form
    <code>book:XYZ</code> are resolved by looking in book.xml for the @label
    XYZ, and then using the associated href, with ..'s added as appropriate.
    This is done with an XMLFileModule and SimpleMappingMetaModule, defined in
    cocoon.xconf.
    </p>
    <p>Here are two links to demonstrate</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="book:Overview">book:Overview</a></li>
      <li><a href="book:Installing">book:Installing</a></li>
    </ul>
