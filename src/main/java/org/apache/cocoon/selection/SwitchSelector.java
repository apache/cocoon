/**
 * SwitchSelector is an enhanced Selector interface that allows a
 * context object to be created to optimize selector conditional testing.
 *
 * <p>
 * The original Selector interface supports an <code>if-then-else</code> style
 * of conditional testing depending on whether a particular expression is true.
 * This causes Selector.select() to be invoked for each &lt;map:when&gt;
 * statement which may be undesirable due to performance or logic reasons.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *  <pre>
 *  Example, the following sitemap snippet:
 *
 *  &lt;map:select type="aSelector"&gt;
 *   &lt;map:when test="test-expr1"&gt;...&lt;/map:when&gt;
 *   &lt;map:when test="test-expr2"&gt;...&lt;/map:when&gt;
 *  &lt;/map:select&gt;
 *
 *  is interpreted as (pseudo-code):
 *
 *  if (aSelector.select("test-expr1", objectModel, params)) {
 *   ...
 *  } else if (aSelector.select("test-expr2", objectModel, params)) {
 *   ...
 *  }
 *
 *  ie. aSelector.select(...) is called once for each &lt;map:when&gt;
 *  statement.
 *  </pre>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * SwitchSelector allows the developer to first create a
 * context object which is passed with each call to select(). This context
 * object is created before any conditional tests are made, and hence can be
 * used to optimize conditional testing.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *  <pre>
 *  The above example implemented as a SwitchSelector would be
 *  interpreted as (psuedo-code):
 *
 *  Object selectorContext = aSelector.getSelectorContext(objectModel, params);
 *  
 *  if (aSelector.select("test-expr1", selectorContext)) {
 *   ...
 *  else if (aSelector.select("test-expr2", selectorContext)) {
 *   ...
 *  }
 *
 *  ie. the bulk of the selector's work is done in getSelectorContext(),
 *  select() simply compares whether the expression should be considered true. 
 *  </pre>
 * </p>
