/**
 * RequestModule provides access to Request object properties.
 * To get access to request properties use XPath syntax, e.g. to get the request
 * context path use <code>'contextPath'</code> as the attribute name.<br/>
 * More complex expressions are also supported, e.g.:
 * <pre>
 * 'userPrincipal/name'
 * </pre>
 * will return the name property of the Principal object returned by the
 * request.getUserPrincipal() method. If requested object is not found then
 * an exception will be thrown.
