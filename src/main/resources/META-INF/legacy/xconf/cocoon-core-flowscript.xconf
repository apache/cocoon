      |  The <flow-interpreters> element is used to describe the flowscript
      |  engines usedd by the current instance.
      |
      |  The attributes recognized by the <flow-interpreters> element are:
      |
      |    default (string value):
      |
      |       the default interpreted language assumed for <map:script>
      |       elements which do not specify a "language" attribute. If not
      |       present, the first language that's described within the
      |       <flow-interpreters> element is assumed to be the default
      |       language.
      |
      |  Within <flow-interpreters> only <component-instance> elements are
      |  recognized. The attributes recognized by this element are "name"
      |  and "class". "name" specifies the name of a scripting language,
      |  and "class" defines the Java class that implements it. See
      |  org.apache.cocoon.components.flow.Interpreter for the Cocoon
      |  interface with an scripting language interpreter.
      |
      |  A <component-instance> element contains as subelements the
      |  following elements:
      |
      |    reload-scripts (boolean value, default false):
      |       whether to check if the scripts source files are modified.
      |       Checking for modification is an expensive operation, so leave
      |       it disabled in a production environment. If not present it is
      |       assumed to be "false" (if no property is overriding this). When
      |       "true" *all* script files are
      |       checked for modification on each function invocation done using
      |       <map:call function="...">, but not more frequent than the value
      |       of "check-time" (see below).
      |       The default for this function is determined by the value of the
      |       reloading property 'org.apache.cocoon.reloading.flow'.
      |
      |    check-time (long value, default 1000):
      |       time in miliseconds between the checks for the last modification
      |       date of script files.
      |
      |    debugger (boolean value, default false):
      |       whether support for the JavaScript debugger should be enabled in
      |       the control flow.
