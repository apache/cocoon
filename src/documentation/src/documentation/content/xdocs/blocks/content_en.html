<h1>Cocoon Blocks</h1>
<h2>What is a block?</h2>

<h2>Core blocks, non-core blocks and external blocks</h2>
<p>The main goal of Cocoon blocks is to reduce Cocoon to a core.&nbsp;
All functionality that isn't&nbsp; absolutly necessary to run Cocoon,
is put into a block. But some of those blocks are needed by the most of
our users and therefore they will also be part of a Cocoon
distribution. Those blocks (Javaflow, Cocoon Forms, XML-Templating) are
calledCore Blocks . (This doesn't mean that core blocks can't be
released between Cocoon releases! Core blocks can be compared to the
JDT or Ant plug-in of Eclipse which are part of every Eclipse
distribution.)<br>
<br>
All other blocks (Non-Core Blocks) should sooner or later become
independant from Cocoon and need to be downloaded and installed
separatly. This is a major refactoring and will take time until it is
finished. Some of these blocks may become their own projects, some will
remain under the umbrella of the Cocoon project and some will move away
to other hosts like cocoondev.org or Sourceforge.<br>
<br>
External blocks have never been part of a Cocoon.</p>
