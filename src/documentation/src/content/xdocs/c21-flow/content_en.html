<h1>Control Flow</h1>
      
<p>Cocoon has advanced control flow, the ability to describe the
      order of Web pages that have to be sent to the client, at any
      given point in time in an application.</p>

      
<p>Traditional Web applications try to model the control flow of
      a Web application by modeling the application as a finite state
      machine (FSM). In this model, the Web application is composed of
      multiple states, but the application can be only in one state at
      a time. Any request received by the application transitions it
      into a different state. During such a transition, the application
      may perform various side-effects, such as updating objects
      either in memory or in a database. Another important side-effect
      of such a transition is that a Web page is sent back to the
      client browser.</p>

      
<p>For simple Web applications, this model works fine. However,
      as the application grows, the number of states and transitions
      between them grows as well, and it becomes hard to visualize
      what's happening in the application.</p>

      
<p>Moreover, the interactions in some applications are more
      complex than a simple finite state machine. In such cases it's
      much easier to think of and implement the application as a program,
      rather than a FSM.</p>

      
<p>By using a high level programming concept called
      <em>continuations</em>, Cocoon tries to solve this problem, and
      promises to allow the control flow in Web applications to be
      modeled as a normal program.</p>
