<h1>Concept</h1>
      
<p>Used to trigger an action event on the server side. Usually presented
      as a button the user can press (though this is not required). When an
      action widget was activated, validation will not be performed. This
      is because usually it would be strange to have other fields validated
      when the user's intention wasn't really to submit the form. If you want
      validation to happen, use the <a href="widget_submit.html">submit widget</a>.
      After pressing an action
      button, the form will normally always be redisplayed, unless the event
      handling code explicitely disables this (by using the method <span class="codefrag">endFormProcessing</span>
      method on the <span class="codefrag">Form</span> object).</p>
    

    
<h1>Configuration</h1>
      
<pre class="code">&lt;fd:action id="..." action-command="..."&gt;
  &lt;fd:label&gt;...&lt;/fd:label&gt;
  &lt;fd:help&gt;...&lt;/fd:help&gt;
  &lt;fd:hint&gt;...&lt;/fd:hint&gt;
  &lt;fd:on-action&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/fd:on-action&gt;
&lt;/fd:action&gt;</pre>

      
<p>The <strong>action-command</strong> attribute specifies a name
      that will be part of the event generated by this widget. It can be
      used to distinguish events originated from this fd:action from another one.</p>

      
<p>For more information on how event handlers are defined, see
      <a href="eventhandling.html">Event Handling</a>. The interface
      to be implemented for Java event listeners is
      <span class="codefrag">org.apache.cocoon.forms.event.ActionListener</span>.
      The WidgetEvent subclass is <span class="codefrag">org.apache.cocoon.forms.event.ActionEvent</span>.</p>
