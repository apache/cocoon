<h1>Concept</h1>
      
<p>The submit widget, usually rendered as a button, is used by
      the user to submit the form. The submit widget is a special kind
      of action widget, thus also has the same functionality as an action
      widget, however the submit widget does trigger validation and its
      purpose is to end the form.</p>

      
<p>You don't need to use a submit widget to submit a form. For example,
      in your HTML template you can simply put:</p>

      
<pre class="code">&lt;input type="submit"/&gt;</pre>

      
<p>to be able to submit the form. Using a submit widget enables
      some extra functionality. You can control whether validation
      should be performed. You can put multiple submit widgets on
      a form and add different event handlers to them.</p>

      
<p>While a submit widget has the explicit purpose to submit a
      form, a form can also be submitted by other widgets. One example
      is the already mentioned <a href="widget_action.html">action
      widget</a>. It is however also possible to automatically submit
      a form when a widget changes its value, so that server-side event
      value-changed event listeners can be triggerd. This can be specified
      using <span class="codefrag">&lt;fi:styling submit-on-change="true"/&gt;</span> in
      the form template (see <a href="xslt.html">XSLT</a> for more
      information on the <span class="codefrag">fi:styling</span> directive).</p>

      
<p>To know which widget caused the form to be submitted, use the
      method <span class="codefrag">getSubmitWidget</span> of the <span class="codefrag">Form</span> object.</p>
    

    
<h1>Configuration</h1>
      
<pre class="code">&lt;fd:submit id="..." action-command="..." validate="true|false"&gt;
  &lt;fd:label&gt;...&lt;/fd:label&gt;
  &lt;fd:help&gt;...&lt;/fd:help&gt;
  &lt;fd:hint&gt;...&lt;/fd:hint&gt;
  &lt;fd:on-action&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/fd:on-action&gt;
&lt;/fd:submit&gt;</pre>

      
<p>The optional attribute validate, which is true by default, can
      be used to disable validation. The difference between an action
      widget and a submit widget with validate="false" is that a submit
      widget with validate="false" will end form processing, thus the form
      will not be redisplayed. Ultimately, it is of course the controller
      who decides this, but the forms hint towards the controller is that
      it shouldn't be redisplayed, and this is exactly what the flowscript
      integration library does.</p>
