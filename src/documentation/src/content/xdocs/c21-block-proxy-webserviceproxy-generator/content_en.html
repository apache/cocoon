<h1>What Is Web Syndication?</h1>
      
<p>Web Site Syndication has gained popularity as more and more web sites cross reference each
        other, not only by a single hyperlink, but also by embedding parts of their content. The
        idea was pioneered by Netscape with their Rich Site Summary (RSS)
        (<a class="external" href="http://www.oasis-open.org/cover/rss.html">http://www.oasis-open.org/cover/rss.html</a>)
        XML format. RSS was developed in early 1999 to populate Netscape's My Netscape portal with
        external newsfeeds ("channels"). Since then RSS has taken on a life of its own and now
        thousands of Web sites use RSS as a "what's new" mechanism to drive traffic their way.
      </p>
      
<p>The current RSS 1.0 standard is an application of Resource Description Framework (RDF)
        (<a class="external" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/">http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/</a>). RDF
        is a framework for describing and interchanging metadata. The RDF framework is extensible
        and allows adding new types of entities. It also gives meaning to resources to enable
        automated processing of Web resources.
      </p>
      
<p>RSS is unarguably an example of an organically grown and widely accepted standard. For long
        it was not endorsed by any of the popular standards committees. Even so it quickly became
        popular and found a large number of creative uses. Lately though it has reached its limits.
        There is a demand for more advanced portal syndication which RSS cannot satisfy.
      </p>
    

    
<h1>Going beyond RSS with Web Services</h1>
      
<p>Latest generation web portals demand more than simply posting cross linked news stories
        from RSS. Embedding and personalizing rich content and behavior from remote portals is
        becoming necessity. Limited success has been achieved through complex and sophisticated
        backend integration via proprietary or Web Services compliant protocols. Recognizing the
        growing demand, influential organizations have attempted to develop new languages such as:

<h2>Web Services Experience Language (WSXL)</h2>
<p>

        </p>
<p>
          
<em>"WSXL is a Web services centric component model for interactive Web applications. WSXL
            is designed to achieve two main goals: enable businesses to distribute Web applications

            by leveraging existing applications across the Web."
          </em>
        
</p>

      
<h2>Web Services Inspection Language (WSIL)</h2>
<p>

            "inspection.wsil" and be located at a common entry point to the web site. This paves the
            way for future Web services "crawlers" to locate and parse WSIL documents for Web
            service search engines."

<p>While these efforts are certainly worthwhile and promising, it will most likely take years
        before they pass the filters of real life use before they can claim widespread adoption. All
        of them ask for a thick infrastructure layer to support implementations. While possible, it
        is unlikely that mainstream deployment will be achieved instantly.
      </p>
      
<p>Not all is lost though. Fortunately, there is way to satisfy a large portion of the
        syndication requirements by applying already established technologies and tools. We will
        illustrate the architecture of a possible solution using an open source framework for XML
        Publishing - Apache Cocoon.
      </p>
    

    
<h1>Apache Cocoon</h1>

          on a separation of concerns between content, logic and style. To top this all off,
          Cocoon's centralized configuration system and sophisticated caching help you to create,
          deploy and maintain rock-solid XML server applications".
        </em>
      
</p>
      
<p>First, let's describe a typical use case scenario: User logs in to a familiar portal and
        happily surfs about. At some point the user clicks on a link which leads to a strange page.
        It has the portal logo, even shows the same login id but still looks very different and
        unfriendly ... After some time and frustration the user gets used to switching back and
        forth between the two faces of the portal ... while looking for another provider which
        offers both services in a coherent graphical interface.
      </p>
      
<p>For those who have never had similar experience, we will give a popular example. Yahoo! Autos
        (<a class="external" href="http://autos.yahoo.com/finance.html?refsrc=autos/insurance">http://autos.yahoo.com/finance.html?refsrc=autos/insurance</a>)
        offers an easy to use interactive catalog of cars. However when it comes to insuring an
        automobile, applying for a loan or buying a car, the web site hyperlinks to a co-branded
        page of another company. For example Lending Tree
        (<a class="external" href="https://www.lendingtree.com/newauto/secure/ctl_borrower.asp?page=loan_selection&verb=continue&O_loan_type=LOAN_TYPE_AUTO&bp=yahooautos&source=40050&alliance=true&SITEID=&templxlname=&templxssn1=&templxssn2=&templxssn3=">https://www.lendingtree.com/newauto/.....</a> )
        will show Yahoo! Autos logo at the top of the screen, however the rest of the page looks
        very different than any other Yahoo! page. All the personalization spoils that a Yahoo! user
        enjoys are lost as soon as the application for a loan begins. Not only the colors and layout
        are different. A login session with Yahoo! does not carry over to Lending Tree. On top of
        that a pop-up window appears when switching between the two sites, which reads "You are
        about to view pages over a secure connection ...". When added up these "negligible"
        inadequacies, lead to an overall poor experience, which is certainly not the original
        intent of the Yahoo! content producers.
      </p>
      
<p>Now as we have an idea of how things are not supposed to work, we will show that
        outsourcing interactive components to a third party site, while preserving the look &amp;
        feel of the original portal is still possible when done right. As we mentioned Cocoon offers
        a solution. Since Cocoon is a very sophisticated framework, an indepth analysis of its
        features is beyond the scope of this text to cover.
      </p>
    

    
<h1>Web Services Proxy to the rescue</h1>
      
<p>The latest version of Cocoon is 2.1 and it has a new Web Service Proxy component. It is
        this component which we shall focus on for the reminder of the text. To follow the rest of
        the article, it will be useful (but not essential) to have a basic knowledge of Cocoon 2.
      </p>
      
<p>Combined with the XMLForm (which is not part of Cocoon anymore)
        component of Cocoon 2 and XSLT, the Web Service Proxy component allows vendors to share
        interactive content with little effort. The Web Service Proxy takes advantage of the fact
        that a Cocoon web application produces XML content, which is later translated into multiple
        presentation formats, like HTML or WML. Once the proxy is plugged in the Cocoon sitemap, it
        transparently pipes browser requests to a remote web application and returns the response
        back to the sitemap for local styling. Receiving a client independent XML format, allows the
        local site to pull content and style it with XSLT with the desired Look &amp; Feel.
      </p>
      
<p>
        
<strong>
          Q. Ok, styling presentation is easy to understand, but how is a form submitted to the original site?
        </strong>
      
</p>
      
<p>The XMLForm component is the answer. It uses W3C XForms included in the XML content which
        allows the end user to directly interact with the remote server through the embedding site.
        The form markup in the XML content of an embedded page uses relative URL address for the
        target action, when the end user submits, the form data is sent to the containing site,
        which captures the form data and the relative URL. The Web Service Proxy then takes this
        information and re-submits it to the original site. It then reads the XML response and makes
        it available to the sitemap for styling again.
      </p>
      
<p>
        
<strong>Q. Hmm ... a typical web application maintains a user session while navigating.
          How is the containing site propagating the end user session to the embedded site?
        </strong>
      
</p>
      
<p>The answer is simple. The Web Service Proxy simply hooks to the end user session and
        automatically starts its own session with the remote site. If the remote site requires
        authentication, then the developer of the local web site has to pass the user credentials
        as parameters to the WebServiceProxyGenerator.
      </p>
      
<p>
        
<strong>Q. What transport protocols are supported?</strong>
      
</p>
      
<p>HTTP 1.0, HTTP 1.1, HTTPS.</p>
      
<p>Below we will illustrate the architecture of the solution with some example code and
        figures.
      </p>
      
<div align="center">

<em>Figure 1 - Architecture of the Web Service Proxy Solution. As opposed to a traditional
          proxy server, the Web Services Proxy captures user input and allows the web site to remain
          coherent even when the functionality for some of its components is delivered remotely.

<em>Figure 2 - Illustration of the data flow for a composite page. Some of the content is
          locally constructed, the rest is obtained remotely. Finally the same styling is applied
          and the user facing page appears consistent.
        </em>
      
</p>
      
<p>Now we will show a snippet of the sitemap which employs the Web Service Proxy. Notice its
        brevity! The Web Service Proxy completely handles the content and navigation logic between
        the two portals. Only stylesheets are additionally required to translate the remotely
        retrieved documents into a user friendly format.

<p>The listing above contains markup in the XMLForm namespace. It is a presentation
        independent way to specify input controls. Being XForms compliant it is easy to learn and
        use. The XSLT stylesheets used to convert the XML above are very simple and will not be
        listed here. They can found in the Cocoon 2.1 distribution.
      </p>
    

    
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
      
<p>The Web Service Proxy component is tightly integrated with the Cocoon framework and is
        particularly convenient to use in combination with XMLForm to enable syndication of website
        functionality. With the presented sample, we only scratched the service of the possible
        applications. It is easy to see though for a creative mind how it can be extended in
        multiple directions. Although the solution we offered is conveniently applied with Cocoon,
        the concepts are generally applicable outside the framework as well. Exposing a Web
        Application functionality via XML is not just a "neat" feature any more. It opens the gates
        to a constellation of opportunities, not possible with the classical Model-2 approach where
        the business logic is directly tied to a graphical output like HTML.
      </p>

      
<h2>Have more questions?</h2>
<p>Look at the online demo available in the Cocoon distribution in the samples:
          <span class="codefrag">http://{host}:{port}/{contextPath}/samples/proxy/</span>.
        </p>
<p>Then study the source code and if you still have questions, join the cocoon users email
          list and ask. If you have ideas for improvement then you are more than welcome to discuss
          it on the cocoon development email list and eventually submit a patch through the Apache
          bug tracking system.
