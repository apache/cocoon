<h1>The usual Cocoon Developer profile</h1>
      
<p>As a Cocoon developer (someone who develops components for Cocoon), you
         need of course everything you have to know as a Cocoon user. In addition
         you should have a basic understanding of the following technologies.
         Again, this knowledge is not specific to Cocoon; it can be used for
         building web applications with different frameworks as well.
      </p>

<h1>Overview</h1>

  
<p>Here will soon appear an overview of the developer perspective.
  </p>
  
<p>If you are interested in developing real-world web-applications requiring
    form handling, authentication or even developing your own portal, have a 
    look at the <a href="webapps/index.html">web application documentation</a>.</p>
  
<p>The actual developer documentation is available from the side-panel.
