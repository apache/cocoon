<h1>A different approach</h1>
      
<p>Web applications are essentially event-driven
      applications. Such applications have to react to events
      generated from the client browser, and they respond to these
      perhaps by changing their internal state and generating a
      response.</p>

      
<p>The result is that even a simple application that needs to
      collect some information from the user using more than one page,
      has to somehow maintain the input accumulated so far from the
      user. This input is a characteristic of the application
      state. Another characteristic of the application state is where
      the program processing is.</p>

      
<p>Let's look at an example. Suppose we want to write a very
      simple calculator, which collects the numbers to be added, as
      well as the operator, each in a separate page. It would be very
      nice if we could write something like this:</p>

      
<pre class="code">
function calculator()
{
  var a, b, operator;

  cocoon.sendPageAndWait("getA.html");
  a = cocoon.request.get("a");

  cocoon.sendPageAndWait("getB.html");
  b = cocoon.request.get("b");

  cocoon.sendPageAndWait("getOperator.html");
  operator = cocoon.request.get("op");

  try {
    if (operator == "plus")
      cocoon.sendPage("result.html", {result: a + b});
    else if (operator == "minus")
      cocoon.sendPage("result.html", {result: a - b});
    else if (operator == "multiply")
      cocoon.sendPage("result.html", {result: a * b});
    else if (operator == "divide")
      cocoon.sendPage("result.html", {result: a / b});
    else
      cocoon.sendPage("invalidOperator.html", {operator: operator});
  }
  catch (exception) {
    cocoon.sendPage("error.html", {message: "Operation failed: " + exception.toString()});
  }
}
</pre>

      
<p>In this example, the <span class="codefrag">calculator</span> function is
      called to start the calculator application. We'd like the
      <span class="codefrag">sendPageAndWait</span> function to be a special function, that
      takes as arguments an HTML file to be sent as response, and some
      optional data that needs to be placed dynamically in it. We
      would like <span class="codefrag">sendPageAndWait</span> to send the response page and
      then block the executing thread, until the user clicks on a link
      in the response page, which sends a request back to the
      server. This request resumes the processing at the point it was
      left, right after the call to <span class="codefrag">sendPageAndWait</span>.</p>

      
<p>This approach looks very powerful, since the flow of pages
      within the application can be described as a normal
      program. Using this approach you no longer have to think of your
      Web application as a finite state machine, which transitions
      from one state to another, and in the process generates response
      pages.</p>

      
<p>A big disadvantage of the approach above is that we need to
      maintain a thread alive until the user hits the link on the
      response page. This is clearly very expensive!</p>

      
<p>It would be very nice if we could capture the state of the
      application, its stack of function calls, which includes local
      variables, the global variables and the program counter, and
      save them into an object. If this object would give us the
      ability to restart the processing from the point stored in it,
      this would be what we need!</p>

      
<h2>What are continuations?</h2>
<p>A continuation is exactly the type of object that we need.
  Think of a continuation as an object that, for a given point
  in your program, contains a snapshot of the stack trace,
  including all the local variables, and the program
  counter. You can not only store these things in the
  continuation object, but also restore the execution of the
  program from a continuation object. This means that the stack
  trace and the program counter of the running program become
  the ones stored in a continuation.</p>
<p>Continuations are powerful concepts from the world of
  functional languages, like <a class="external" href="http://www.schemers.org/">Scheme</a>, but they are
  becoming popular in other languages as well.</p>
