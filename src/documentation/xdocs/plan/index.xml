 <s1 title="Overview">

  <p>This is a collection of notes to assist with long-term planning and
   development.
  </p>

  <p>There is much discussion of issues and Random Thought (RT) threads on
   the <code>cocoon-dev</code> mailing list (and elsewhere). However, details
   get lost in the sheer volume. This is the place to document the summary of
   discussions on some key topics. Some new and complex capabilities will take
   lots of design and specification before they can be implemented.
  </p>

  <p>Another use for this collection of notes is as a place to quickly store
   a snippet from an email discussion or even a link to a discussion thread.
   The concepts can then be fleshed-out over time.
  </p>

  <p>Anyone can participate in this process. Please get involved in discussion
   on the <link href="http://cocoon.apache.org/community/mail-lists.html">mailing lists</link> and contribute
   patches for these summary planning
   documents via the normal <link href="http://cocoon.apache.org/community/contrib.html">contribution</link>
   process.
  </p>

  <p>These planning documents are intended to be concise notes only. They are
   also ever-evolving, because as issues are addressed these notes will be
   revised.
