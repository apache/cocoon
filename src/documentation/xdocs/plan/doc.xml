 <s1 title="Overview">

  <p>
There is a concerted effort underway at this time to improve Cocoon's documentation. This effort is based on the belief that open source documents can be as first-rate as the software on which they are based. However, such an endeavor is entirely dependent upon vital and timely forms of contributions from developers and users alike. Make no mistake about it; everyone is needed and invited to participate in this effort!
  </p>
  <p>
While we have a lot to do, there are evolving structures in place to facilitate and enhance your efforts. We have numerous guidelines for authoring documents, a document-specific email list, and a complementary documentation architectural project at <link href="http://xml.apache.org/forrest/">Forrest</link>. If you choose to become involved, you will discover many like-minded developers and users who care about Cocoon documentation and will support your effort. Here are a few ideas to help you get started.

  <s2 title="Cocoon Wikis">
  <p>
Cocoon has two promising and complementary wiki efforts underway.
</p>
  <ul>
  <li>
<link href="http://wiki.apache.org/cocoon/">Cocoon Wiki</link> focuses on content development for the Cocoon project. It is designed to facilitate document development and collaboration from all levels of Cocoon users. Documents include FAQs, snippets, how-tos, tutorials, RTs (random thoughts), dreams, surveys, and more. The preliminary focus of this the wiki is to serve as a documentation "breeding ground," where docs can "grow" until mature enough to become official cvs docs. However, it already represents a lively and valid document resource in its own right.
  </li>
  <li>
<link href="http://www.anyware-tech.com/wikiland/">Wikiland</link> is an ongoing development effort to build a Cocoon-based wiki architecture. Wikiland features a Cocoon dictionary as the pretext to use, test and develop the wiki. The project is seeking Cocoon-oriented developers to further its development. For more information, see the <link href="http://rossel.free.fr/" >Wikiland home page.</link>
  </li>
  </ul>
