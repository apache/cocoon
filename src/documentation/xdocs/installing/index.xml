    <s1 title="System Requirements">
      <p>
       Apache Cocoon requires the following systems to be already installed in your system:
      </p>

      <p><strong>Java Virtual Machine</strong>
       A Java 1.3 or later compatible virtual machine must be present for both
       command line and servlet type usage of Apache Cocoon. Note that all servlet engines
       require a JVM to run so if you are already using servlets you already have
       one installed.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Servlet Engine</strong>
       A Servlet 2.2 compliant servlet engine must be present in order to support
       servlet operation and dynamic request handling. Note that this requirement
       is optional for command line operation.
      </p>

      <p>If you don't have a servlet engine installed, well, stop right here and
      go to the Apache Tomcat project
      <link href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/</link>
      then come back when you are done.</p>
    </s1>

    <s1 title="Getting Apache Cocoon">
      <p>
       You have three choices for getting Cocoon: you can either download
       a stable release, or you can download development snapshot, or you can
       get the latest development version directly from the cvs repository.
      </p>
      <s2 title="Download a distribution">
       <p>
        You can simply download the latest official release from the
        <link href="http://cocoon.apache.org/dist/">Cocoon distribution</link>
        directory.
       </p>
      </s2>
      <s2 title="Download a development snapshot">
       <p>
        You also can download one of the development snapshots from the
        <link href="http://xml.apache.org/cocoon/mirror.cgi#nightly">CVS snapshots</link>
        directory.
       </p>

          call "cvs -z3 update -d -P".</p>
      </s2>
    </s1>

    <s1 title="Configuring Environment">
      <s2 title="Set JAVA_HOME environment variable">
        <p>Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to the root directory of
          the Java Development Kit installed on your machine. To do this simply type:</p>

<source>
[unix]  JAVA_HOME=/path/to/java/
[win32] SET JAVA_HOME=c:\path\to\java</source>

        <p>Your mileage may vary, but you know how to setup environments, right?</p>
      </s2>

      <s2 title="Java 1.4 configuration">
        <p>Cocoon requires more recent versions of the Xerces and Xalan libraries
          than those shipped with j2se 1.4. To override bundled libraries, follow
          these steps:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Create <code>%JAVA_HOME%\jre\lib\endorsed</code> directory.
          </li>
          <li>
            Copy <code>xerces-XXX.jar</code>, <code>xalan-XXX.jar</code>,
            and the <code>xml-apis.jar</code> from the
            <code>.\lib\core\</code> to the
            <code>%JAVA_HOME%\jre\lib\endorsed\</code> directory.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Due to changes in JDBC between JDK 1.3 and JDK 1.4, it is not possible 
           to use Cocoon build on JDK 1.3 with JDK 1.4 when it comes to database
           connections.</p>
        <p>So if you want to use Cocoon with JDK 1.4, you have to download the
           source distribution and build it by hand.
        </p>
      </s2>

      <s2 title="JDK Dependency">
        <p>Cocoon requires a Java compiler for some components like XSP etc.
           The default configuration of Cocoon does not use the compiler provided
           with the JDK but it's own version.
        </p>
        <p>However, if you want to use the JDK compiler, you have to change the
           configuration of Cocoon and make sure that the correct compiler is
           in the <code>WEB-INF/lib</code> directory. You can find the compiler
           in <code>%JAVA_HOME%/lib/javac.jar</code>.
        </p>
        <p>If you use the source distribution of Cocoon, the build system takes 
           care of this and copies the jar file to the appropriate directory. 
           If you use the binary distribution or want to switch between different
           JDKs you have to copy <code>%JAVA_HOME%/lib/javac.jar</code> to
           <code>WEB-INF/lib/javac.jar</code> replacing the existing version.
        </p>
      </s2>

      <s2 title="UNIX with X server">
        <p>Cocoon is bundled with the <link href="http://xml.apache.org/batik/">Batik</link>
          (SVG rasterization toolkit) to deliver SVG imaging capabilities. Batik uses Java
          <code>java.awt</code> library, which (at least in Sun JDK before 1.4) requires
          graphics display. This means that X server must be running and Cocoon should
          have permission to connect to it.</p>

        <p>Easiest way to avoid X server connection problem (and to have mentioned permission)
          is to install and run Cocoon and entire servlet engine of your choice under regular
          user account.</p>

        <p>For security, and many other reasons, X server can be replaced by Xfvb
          or PJA (alternative awt implementation).</p>

        <note>Sun JDK 1.4 does not require graphics display anymore, but Java has to be
          started with the argument <code>-Djava.awt.headless=true</code>,
          and X libraries still must be installed.</note>
      </s2>

      <s2 title="Headless UNIX and PJA">
        <p>If you are using unix with the Sun JDK 1.4, it can run in the
          headless environment (but you still must have X libraries installed!)
          when following option is provided on Java startup:</p>

        <source>-Djava.awt.headless=true</source>

        <note>If you use Tomcat, this can be done by setting environment variable
          CATALINA_OPTS (Tomcat 4.x), or TOMCAT_OPTS (Tomcat 3.x):</note>

        <source>export CATALINA_OPTS='-Djava.awt.headless=true'</source>

        <p>If you are using unix with the Sun JDK 1.3.1 or earlier, it's awt
          implementation requires you to use X even if you aren't actually
          displaying anything. One simple solution is to use a different
          implementation of the awt.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>From www.eteks.com you can get an awt replacement that doesn't need X:
            <link href="http://www.eteks.com/pja/en/">http://www.eteks.com/pja/en/</link>.</li>
          <li>Then add the following options to the Java command starting your container:
          </li>
        </ol>

<source>
-Xbootclasspath/a:/path/to/pja.jar
-Dawt.toolkit=com.eteks.awt.PJAToolkit
-Djava.awt.graphicsenv=com.eteks.java2d.PJAGraphicsEnvironment
-Djava.awt.fonts=/usr/local/jdk/jre/lib/fonts/</source>


        <note>If you use Tomcat, this can be done by setting environment variable
          CATALINA_OPTS (Tomcat 4.x), or TOMCAT_OPTS (Tomcat 3.x):</note>

<source>
export CATALINA_OPTS='-Xbootclasspath/a:/path/to/pja.jar \
    -Dawt.toolkit=com.eteks.awt.PJAToolkit \
    -Djava.awt.graphicsenv=com.eteks.java2d.PJAGraphicsEnvironment \
    -Djava.awt.fonts=/usr/local/jdk/jre/lib/fonts/'</source>

      </s2>
    </s1>

    <s1 title="Building Cocoon">
      <p>If you downloaded the binary distribution of Cocoon, you can
        skip this chapter and proceed to the "Installing Cocoon".
      </p>

<!-- TODO: Replacing HSQLDB with other SQL DB
    <s2 title="Making the sql examples work out of the box">
     <p>
      The sample web application delivered with Cocoon contains some
      examples which require a sql database. To make them work out of
      the box, the hsqldb is included. However, this database needs
      the installation path to work correctly. Using Tomcat (see notes
      below) you could use the following instruction to directly
      build a web application which is alreary configured for the sql
      examples. The build script will copy it directly to your webapps
      directory.
     </p>
      <source>
[unix]
./build.sh  -Dinstall.war={path-to-webapps-dir} install
[win32]
.\build.bat -Dinstall.war={path-to-webapps-dir} install
      </source>
      <p>
       Please note that this might not work with all servlet engines
       and that you must follow the steps below, too.
      </p>
    </s2>
-->

    <s2 title="Adding optional components">
     <p>
      Some of the components delivered with Cocoon require additional libraries,
      e.g. the Php generator or the FOP serializer (for more information about
      these components, refer to their documentation).
     </p>
     <p>
      Most of these libraries are already included in the distribution, but some
      have to be downloaded manually. The build task checks whether you have
      the required libraries or not and includes the optional components only
      if you have the libraries available when you build Cocoon. Refer to the
      <link href="jars.html">Cocoon JARs</link> page for a list of libraries
      and locations where you could get them.
     </p>
     <p>
      A library/package is available to the build process when it is located
      in the <code>./lib/optional</code> or the <code>./lib/local</code> directory.
     </p>
     <p>
      The following table contains a list of the optional components,
      their needed libraries and if they are already included or not.
     </p>
     <!-- TODO: Update -->
     <table>
       <tr>
         <th>Component</th>
         <th>Required Library</th>

         <td><link href="http://www.jfor.org">jfor</link></td>
         <td>No</td>
       </tr>
     </table>
     <p>If you want to add additional libraries, put them in the <code>./lib/local</code>
       directory as this directory is not touched by CVS.
       <strong>Note:</strong> If you added a library/package, you
      need to rebuild Cocoon as described in 'Create the Cocoon WAR package'.
     </p>
    </s2>
    <s2 title="Building a minimal Cocoon">
      <p>If you want to build a minimal Cocoon, simply remove all optional libraries
        from the <code>./lib/local</code> and the <code>./lib/optional</code> directory.
        Make a <code>build clean</code> and then a build with the target you want.
        However, if you want to build a web application make sure you leave the
        <code>servlet.jar</code> in the <code>./lib/optional</code> directory.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong>This feature is only available in the latest developer 
        version of Cocoon which you can find in the CVS. </p>
    </s2>
    <s2 title="Running the build">
      <p>Cocoon uses <link href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/">Jakarta Ant</link>
      for the build and installation, and comes with a build script
      ([unix]./build.sh, [win32] .\build.bat) that automates the process.</p>

      <note>If you want to use build.xml directly with your copy of Ant, please
      run the build script at least once after every CVS checkout, to ensure that
      extra initializations like jar copying are done correctly.</note>

      <note>The UNIX build script (build.sh) overrides the existing ANT_HOME variable.</note>

      <p>There are basically two options that can be set as parameters to
      the script: <strong>targets</strong> and <strong>properties</strong>.</p>

      <s3 title="About build targets">
        <p>Targets are the execution units available in
        <link href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/">Ant</link> build files.</p>

        <p>Only one target can be specified per run, by appending it to
        the script invocation:</p>

<source>
[unix]  ./build.sh target
[win32] .\build.bat target</source>

      </s3>

      <s3 title="About build properties">
        <p>A target can use properties, that can, or must in some cases, be specified.
        Multiple properties can be set, by appending them like this to
        the script invocation:</p>

<source>
[unix]  ./build.sh -Dpropertyname=propertyvalue [target]
[win32] .\build.bat -Dpropertyname=propertyvalue [target]</source>

      </s3>

      <s3 title="Cocoon build targets">
        <p>The <strong>build.xml</strong> file comes with some basic
        important targets. If no target is specified, the default one 
        is used (defined in build.xml).</p>

        <note>Some targets are preliminary and their call method will change
        in the future. Preliminary targets are marked as [BETA].</note>
      
        <p>Cocoon targets place work files and results in a build directory
        under the cocoon root. The only exception are the distribution targets
        that build in a directory called dist.</p> 
        <p>The target you will most use is propably the <strong>webapp</strong>
          target which builds a Cocoon web application. For more information see below.</p>

  <s1 title="Installing Cocoon">
    <p>In most servlet engines, this is just a matter of copying

    <note>The first time that you start Cocoon, it will take a few
      seconds, since Cocoon needs to compile parts of itself.</note>

    <p>After that, point your browser to
     <code>http://localhost:8080/cocoon/</code> which will generate the live
     <link href="../overview.html#samples">Samples</link> and also lead you
     to the live local Cocoon documentation.</p>

    <note>With the 2.1 version,
     <code>http://localhost:8080/cocoon/</code> goes directly to the
     documentation, while
     <code>http://localhost:8080/cocoon/samples/</code> is the Samples.

    <s2 title="Installing on Tomcat 3.3.X">
      <p>This is a very easy installation.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Build the Cocoon webapp as described above.
        </li>

        <li>
          Copy <code>cocoon/build/cocoon/cocoon.war</code>
          into <code>tomcat/webapps</code> directory.
        </li>

        <li>
          Start Tomcat: Go to the <code>tomcat/bin</code> directory,
          and run the startup script.
        </li>

        <li>
          Open the Cocoon welcome page:
          <code>http://localhost:8080/cocoon/</code>

    <s2 title="Installing on Tomcat 3.2.X">
      <note>Cocoon requires Tomcat version 3.2 or greater. It wouldn't work
        with Tomcat 3.1.X</note>

      <p>Tomcat currently uses a different version of the XML parser
      than Cocoon. To get Cocoon to work, you need to perform the
      following steps:</p>

      <ol>

        <li>
          <strong>Stop Tomcat</strong>
          Go to the tomcat/bin directory, and run the shutdown script.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Delete tomcat/lib/jaxp.jar</strong>
          Tomcat's jaxp.jar is 'sealed', and since xerces contains its
          own implementation of the JAXP standard extension, Java
          will fail to load xerces and report a 'Package Sealing Violation'
          if both are in the classpath.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Rename tomcat/lib/parser.jar to tomcat/lib/zparser.jar</strong>
          Tomcat's parser.jar contains older versions of some the same
          XML APIS that Xerces uses, and these will prevent Xerces from
          functioning properly if they appear before Xerces in the classpath.
          Since Tomcat's startup scripts automatically load all the jar files
          in tomcat/lib in name order, changing the name of the file causes it
          to be loaded last in the classpath.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Copy the cocoon/lib/core/xerces-XXX.jar and cocoon/lib/core/xml-apis.jar
            JAR files to tomcat/lib</strong>
          Cocoon will now be able to see and use the correct XML libraries.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Copy cocoon/build/cocoon/cocoon.war into tomcat/webapps</strong>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Start Tomcat</strong>
          Go to the tomcat/bin directory, and run the startup script.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Start using Cocoon</strong>
          Access the URI
          <code>http://localhost:8080/cocoon/</code>
          with your favorite browser and start to enjoy the world of Cocoon.

      <p>
        Snippet of modified <code>cocoon.xconf</code>. The effect of this
        change is that Cocoon will not try to use a TRAX XSLT transformer factory.
        Using the TRAX XSLT transformer factory under WLS6.1sp1 lead to empty
        <code>sitemap_xmap.java</code> files, indicating that the XSLT processor
        used did not work properly. WLS6.1 has a built-in TRAX XSLT which seems
        not to work properly for Cocoon.
      </p>
      <p>
        The code snippet below configures the xslt processor to use the XALAN transformer
        factory explictly.
        Forcing Cocoon using Xalan XSLT lead to correct <code>sitemap_xmap.java</code>
        files.

      <note>
        The above description does not change any WLS6.1 startup script. Moreover
        other applications will still use the WLS6.1 shipped XSLT processor.

       <ol>
         <li>Extract the <code>cocoon.war</code> file to some directory, using <code>WinZIP</code>
           or a similar utility to extract the files.</li>
         <li>To run HP-AS, go to<strong><code>( Start | Programs | HP Middleware | HP Application Server | System Console).</code></strong>
           <br/>
           The HP-AS Console appears with a Log browser.
           As the HP-AS kernel starts and initializes, messages will appear in the
           status bar of the console.
           Wait for the message 'Kernel started' to appear in the Log browser.
           The following message should display:<br/><br/>
           <code>[10/16/01 16:03:50][localhost_][S]:Kernel "kernel" started.</code><br/><br/>
         </li>

         <li>In the HP-AS console, select <strong>View | Deployment Window</strong>.
           In the <strong>Available Files</strong> pane on the right,
           browse to the the directory you extracted the <code>cocoon.war</code> file to.
           <br/>
           Expand this directory, and then drag and drop the
           <code>cocoon</code> sub-directory node to the <strong>kernel.j2ee-partition</strong> icon
           in the left pane.
         </li>
         <li>When prompted, answer <strong>Yes</strong> to the deployment question.<br/>
           This should create an appropriate entry in the HP-AS j2ee partition configuration file.<br/>

          steps have been tested under Win2000.
        </p>
        <p>To get Cocoon running do the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Stop the default and admin servers if they are running.</li>
          <li>Remove <code>jaxp.jar</code> and <code>parser.jar</code>
            files (Crimson XML parser) from the <code>jrun/lib/ext/</code> directory.
          </li>
          <li>Install Xerces as default XML parser for JRun by copying
            <code>xerces-XXX.jar</code> and <code>xml-apis.jar</code> JAR
            files from the <code>cocoon-2.1/lib/core/</code> to <code>jrun/lib/ext/</code>
            directory.
          </li>
          <li>Update Rhino shipped with JRun with newer version from the Cocoon by
            overwriting <code>jrun/lib/rhino.jar</code> JAR file
            with the <code>cocoon-2.1/lib/optional/rhino-1.5r3.jar</code> file.
          </li>
          <li>Start JRun admin server.</li>
          <li>Start JRun default server.</li>
          <li>Open JRun admin page:
            <code>http://localhost:8000/</code>
          </li>
          <li>Deploy cocoon.war webapp using console. Use same values for

            URI "/cocoon").</li>
          <li>Open the Cocoon welcome page:

          <li>Congratulations! (hopefully) you should see the Cocoon welcome page.</li>
        </ul>
        <note>Instead of deploying WAR file using console, same could be done by copying
          <code>cocoon-2.1/build/cocoon/webapp</code> under <code>jrun/servers/default/</code>
          directory and adding following lines to the <code>jrun/servers/default/local.properties</code>:

      <s2 title="Installing on iPlanet Web Server 4.x and other engines without context management">
        <p>
          iPlanet Web Server 4.x provides the servlet 2.2 API (<code>javax.servlet.*</code> classes),
          but the servlet engine doesn't handle servlet contexts. This means there is no classloader
          built with the contents of <code>WEB-INF/classes</code> and <code>WEB-INF/lib</code> and that
          resolution of context resources (using <code>ServletContext.getResource()</code>) doesn't give
          the expected results.
        </p>
        <p>
          To be able to run on such non-compliant engines, Cocoon provides a bootstrap servlet in
          <code>org.apache.cocoon.BootstrapServlet</code>that handles all the servlet context related
          behaviours needed for proper functioning.
        </p>
        <p>
          To use this bootstrap servlet, configure your servlet engine as follows (how to do it depends
          on the actual engine - see below for iPlanet) :
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>add cocoon.jar (and only this one) in the engine's classpath,</li>
          <li>declare the <code>org.apache.cocoon.servlet.BootstrapServlet</code> servlet,</li>
          <li>add a "<code>context-directory</code>" parameter, whose value is the absolute path to Cocoon's
              context (e.g. "<code>/path/webapp/cocoon</code>"),</li>
          <li>add any other cocoon parameters you want to this servlet (see <code>web.xml</code> for a
              description of available parameters),</li>
          <li>configure a path translation from "/" to the servlet.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For iPlanet Web Server 4.x, this translates to :</p>
        <ul>
          <li>connect to the administration server of your web server,</li>
          <li>in the "Servlet" tabs, select "Configure servlet attributes", and enter the following :
            <ul>
              <li>Servlet Name : <code>cocoon</code></li>
              <li>Servlet Code (class name) : <code>org.apache.cocoon.servlet.BootstrapServlet</code></li>
              <li>Servlet Classpath : <code>/path/webapp/cocoon/WEB-INF/lib/cocoon.jar</code></li>
              <li>Servlet Args : <code>context-directory=/path/webapp/cocoon</code> (and any other Cocoon
                  parameters you want)</li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>select "Configure Servlet Virtual Path Translation" and enter the following :
            <ul>
              <li>Virtual Path : <code>@/.*</code></li>
              <li>Servlet Name : <code>cocoon</code></li>
            </ul>
         </li>

          This section describes the deployment of the Cocoon sample WAR with WebSphere 4.0,
          on its default server. It assumes that you built Cocoon as described above. All
          steps have been tested under Win2000 and WebSphere AEs 4.0.1 a0136.02.
        </p>
        <p>To get Cocoon running do the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Start the server using <code>startServer</code> startup script.</li>
          <li>Open admin page:
            <code>http://localhost:9090/admin/</code>
          </li>
          <li>Deploy cocoon.war webapp using console.</li>
          <li>Save server configuration file.</li>
          <li>Restart the server using <code>stopServer</code> and 
            <code>startServer</code> scripts.</li>
          <li>Open the Cocoon welcome page:
            <code>http://localhost:9080/cocoon/</code>
          </li>
          <li>Congratulations! (hopefully) you should see the Cocoon welcome page.</li>
        </ul>
        <note>WebSphere power users might deploy Cocoon by exploding cocoon.war into
          <code>installedApps</code> directory and editing
          <code>config/server-cfg.xml</code> file.
