 <s1 title="Overview">
 <p>This section contains several documents about developing a portal with Cocoon.</p>
 <p>The <link href="../webapps/portal.html">portal framework</link> is a stable
   portal framework that uses the authentication framework. It can
   be used to quickly develop portal applications.</p> 
<p>The new <link href="portal-block.html">portal engine</link> is a new
  implementation of a portal engine which focuses on more flexibility
  and ease-of-use. The current state of this engine is <em>alpha</em>
  which means that the engine can still change in every aspect.</p>
