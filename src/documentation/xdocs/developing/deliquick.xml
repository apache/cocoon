		<s1 title="DELI Quick Start Guide">
<p>If you are seeing the 'DELI is switched off' message when you try the test pages then you need to enable DELI. If you do not
want to rebuild Cocoon, just
add the following lines to the deployed <code>cocoon.xconf</code>:</p>
				<source><![CDATA[
<deli class="org.apache.cocoon.components.deli.DeliImpl">
   <parameter name="deli-config-file" value="deli/config/deliCocoonConfig.xml"/>
</deli>
]]></source>
<p>However if you are developing with Cocoon and need DELI you may prefer to make the same change to the <code>deli.xconf</code> file in 
<code>src\java\components\deli</code>. When you build Cocoon, this file is inserted into the <code>cocoon.xconf</code> file.</p>

<p>By default DELI recognises Internet Explorer, Netscape, Opera, Amaya
and the Nokia WAP development kit as legacy browsers. If you are 
using a different browser, you may need to edit the 
<code>legacyDevices.xml</code>, the DELI legacy device support file. For more 
details see the <link href="deli.html">DELI documentation</link>.</p>
