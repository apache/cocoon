<s1 title="Overview">
 <p>This section contains several documents about developing real-world web applications
  with Cocoon.</p>
 <p>Cocoon has different modules/concepts for making this task much easier. There are
  components for <link href="session.html">Session handling</link>, the 
  <link href="authentication.html">authentication</link> framework ,
  the <link href="portal.html">portal framework</link> and the newer
  <link href="../portal/index.html">portal engine</link>. You will
  find these components in the latest SVN version of Cocoon. The documentation
  listed in the menu conforms to the current SVN version.</p>
 </s1>
    <s1 title="Introduction">
     <p>A session is a data storage which resides on the server and records
        information about one single user. Cocoon creates a session on demand and
        from that point of time the user is tracked and information can be stored
        inside the session. Each following request of this user is linked to the one
        specific session, so there is always only one session per user on the
        server.</p>
     <p>To avoid a fast growing amount of sessions on the server and the
        overcome potential security problems, a session has usually a valid period of
        time. If during this period no new request comes in from the user, the session
        object on the server will be destroyed by the server (this period of time is
        called session timeout). The web application often allows a user to explictly
        destroy a session.</p>
     <p>The usual web applications create sessions during login of a user and
        destroy them when the user logs out.</p>
