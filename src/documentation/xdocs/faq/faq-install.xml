  <question>
    Why doesn't anything happen when I access 'http://localhost/cocoon/'?
  </question>
  <answer>
    <p>
      You might want to check a few things.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Is your server listening to port 80? If not, you have to call the right
        port, for example, 'http://localhost:8080/cocoon/'. Note that Apache Tomcat
        binds by default to port 8080, NOT 80.
      </li>
      <li>
        Did your servlet engine install the WAR file? You can check this by making
        sure the WAR file was unpacked or connecting to the administration tools
        of your servlet engine.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you didn't restart the servlet engine, do it.
      </li>
      <li>
In Tomcat 4, did you change CATALINA_BASE to a different value than the default CATALINA_HOME? If so, copy the war files to CATALINA_BASE/webapps or set CATALINA_BASE=CATALINA_HOME. Then, restart Tomcat.      
      </li>
    </ul>

  <question>
    Why does Cocoon take so long to start?
  </question>
  <answer>
    <p>
      Cocoon compiles sitemaps into java classes to increase runtime performance.
      This occurs at startup only when the sitemap file is modified. For 
      all other requests, the compiled sitemap is executed. 
      
      <!-- See question #7 
      for information on how to pre-compile the sitemap and the XSP's.-->

  <question>
    Why is cocoon.war so big?
  </question>
  <answer>
    <p>
    	<!-- FIXME: isn't this pizza now -->
      Cocoon.war includes all the libraries it requires to run. This includes 
      several megabytes of Java classes. It also includes the JDK javac compiler
      which must be present in the war file to allow page compilation without 
      classloading problems.

  <question>
    I get a java.lang.VerifyError when accessing 'http://localhost/cocoon/'.
    What's wrong?
  </question>
  <answer>
    <p>
      Cocoon requires a JAXP 1.1 compliant parser. Some servlet engines
      (like Tomcat 3.2.1) use older XML parsers. Replace the XML
      parser with a more recent one (e.g. the Xerces 1.3.0 or newer).
    </p>
    <p>
      For Tomcat 3.2.1, remove the jaxp.jar and the parser.jar from the
      tomcat/lib directory. Copy the xerces.jar to this directory and rename
      it to parser.jar. Before you restart Tomcat, make sure to delete the
      tomcat/work directory.
    </p>

<faq>
 <question>
   Cocoon still won't start, this time I get 
javax.xml.transform.TransformerConfigurationException: Namespace not supported by SAXParser
   in the Cocoon log file.
 </question>
 <answer>
   <p>
     This is a classloader issue with Tomcat and some other servlet engines. Basically
     it means that the Xerces library included with Cocoon is not being found. The solution
     is to place the Xerces library first in the classpath.
   </p>

 <question>
   Cocoon won't start, and I get a &quot;java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.apache.log.LogKit: method
   createLogger(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/apache/log/Logger;
   not found&quot; in my Servlet Container's log.
 </question>
 <answer>
   <p>
     You have an old set of libraries installed. Copy the correct libraries from the
     distribution.
   </p>
   <p>
     Even better, build Cocoon with "build webapp". This build creates a complete WAR file with all necessary libraries included.
   </p>

 <question>
  Windows 95/98 tells me that I don't have enough environment-memory.
 </question>
 <answer>
  <p>
   This is another neat feature from DOS- times.
   To increase environment-space add the following line to your
   config.sys (and restart):
   shell=c:\command.com /E:4096 /P

  <question>
    I'm still stuck, what do I do?
  </question>
  <answer>
    <p>
      Contact the Cocoon Users mail list (users@cocoon.apache.org).
      Please do not contact developers directly for help. Cocoon users are
      generally more responsive because they tend to have more experience than developers
      troubleshooting installation problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cocoon has several log files which are stored in the context where you installed
      Cocoon. These logs are located in '{cocoon}/WEB-INF/logs/' where
      {cocoon} is the context where Cocoon is installed. The
      information contained in that file will help others help you.
