     <s1 title="What's in this track?">
       <p>This track is meant to help you take your first steps with Cocoon, by running
           and exploring the samples.</p>
      </s1>
      <s1 title="Prerequisites">
        <p>You will need a JDK (Java Development Kit) installed on your computer,
            and (obviously) an Internet connection to download Cocoon.</p>
          <p>No prior knowledge of Cocoon is needed to study this track.</p>
       </s1>
      <s1 title="First Steps Track">
          <p>
              Here's our suggestion for your first steps with Cocoon:
          </p>
          <s2 title="Have a look at the samples">
              <p>
                  Start by reading
                  <link href="../howto/howto-explore-samples.html">How to run and explore the Cocoon samples</link>
                  and taking a first look at the Cocoon samples. At this point you might not understand much about how they work,
                  but this will give you a feel of what Cocoon is about.
              </p>
          </s2>
          <s2 title="Study the pipeline and sitemap concepts">
            <p>
                  Next, we suggest that you study the <link href="../userdocs/index.html">basics</link> to find
                  out more about how Cocoon works. You should concentrate on understanding the <em>pipeline</em> and <em>sitemap</em>
                  concepts, you don't need much more at this point.
              </p>
          </s2>
          <s2 title="Study selected samples in more detail">
              <p>
                  Once you understand a bit more about how Cocoon works, we suggest that you go back
                  to a few selected samples that might be of interest to you, to study them in more detail.
              </p>
          </s2>
          <p>
              Going through several iterations of looking at the samples and studying the corresponding
              documentation will help you focus on what you need to understand about Cocoon.
          </p>
          <p>
              With more than 45 blocks as of this writing, the samples
              use a wide variety of tools and
              technologies, and attempting to understand everything will most probably leave you frustrated, so
              it is better to limit yourself to a subset of the samples.
          </p>
              <note>
                  <em>Blocks</em> are components which are largely independent of each other, and which are
                  optional when installing Cocoon.
