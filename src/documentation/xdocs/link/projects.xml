<s1 title="Cocoon-related Projects">
<ul>
<li><link href="http://editxml.sourceforge.net/">EditXML - Managing XML files for Cocoon</link><br/>
	he project Edit XML provides a servlet based solution for managing sets of XML files for XML based publishing systems like Cocoon.
</li>

</li>
<li><link href="http://www.plenix.com/dbprism/">DBPrism XML Framework for Oracle DB</link><br/>
	DBPrism is a servlet engine that works in two different modes: as a standalone servlet, or plugged into the Cocoon publishing framework. 
	In the first mode, DBPrism works like the PLSQL Cartridge of Oracle Web Server. 
	Plugged into the Cocoon framework, DBPrism works as a DB Producer, generating dynamic XML from a database.
</li>
<li><link href="http://jeuclid.sourceforge.net/">JEuclid - MathML Transformer for Cocoon</link><br/>
	The project is a component for the Apache Cocoon project(xml.apache.org) which converts MathML documents to GIF images or SVG.
</li>
<li><link href="http://exformula.d-haven.org/">ExFormula - XForms for Cocoon</link><br/>
	ExFormula is an implementation of the XForms specification.
	It allows you to define XML Models and Instances associated with it, to process dynamic forms based on an end markup.
