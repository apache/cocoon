    <s1 title="What do you need to know before taking-off with Cocoon?">
      <p>Well, the question above is not that easy to answer. It depends on what you
         want to do with Cocoon. If you are a usual user, then you can use Cocoon
         without ever coding Java or knowing how exactly servlet containers work.
         If you become an experienced user of Cocoon you might want to tweak
         and tune your application. Therefore it is helpfull to know Java and
         some basics of servlet containers.
      </p>
      <p>  
         However, if you want to develop with Cocoon (building own components
         to extend Cocoon for example), then you need to programm Java. So, we
         split up this description into two sections: one for users and one for
         developers.
      </p>

    <s1 title="The usual Cocoon User profile">
      <p>Before getting started, you should understand some basics for building
         web applications. This knowledge is not specific to Cocoon; it is useful
         for using any web framework.
      </p>
    <ul>
      <li>HTTP and the Request/Response cycle</li>
      <li>Extensible Markup Language (XML)</li>
      <li>Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL)</li>
      <li>HTML</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As Cocoon enforces the separation of concerns you usually don't have
      to care about all these technologies at once. If you are the web
      application developer, you worry more about the request/response
      cycle and XML. A designer for instance has to have more knowledge
      about XML, XSL and HTML. But as always, it's good if you know
      at least something about the other aspects as well, even if you
      don't need them right now.</p>
