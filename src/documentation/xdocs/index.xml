    <s1 title="What is Cocoon?">
      <p>
        Apache Cocoon is a web development framework built around the concepts of
        separation of concerns (making sure people can interact and collaborate on a
        project, without stepping on each other toes) and component-based web
        development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cocoon implements these concepts around the notion of 'component pipelines',
        each component on the pipeline specializing on a particular operation. This
        makes it possible to use a Lego(tm)-like approach in building web solutions,
        hooking together components into pipelines without any required programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cocoon is "<em>web glue for your web application development needs</em>". It
        is a glue that keeps concerns separate and allows parallel evolution of the
        two sides, improving development pace and reducing the chance of conflicts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cocoon has been designed to coexist and interoperate side-by-side with your
        existing J2EE solutions or to give them new functionality without requiring
        any change in the existing infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cocoon interacts with many data sources, including filesystems, RDBMS,
        LDAP, native XML databases, SAP&#174; systems and network-based data sources. 
        It adapts content delivery to the capabilities of different devices like HTML, WML,
        PDF, SVG, and RTF, to name just a few. You can run Cocoon as a Servlet as well as
        through a powerful, commandline interface. The deliberate design of its abstract 
        environment gives you the freedom to extend its functionality to meet your 
        special needs in a highly modular fashion.
