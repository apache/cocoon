    <note>
      <strong>Security warning</strong>: A major security hole has been found in XMLForm and JXForm that
      can allow forged requests to execute arbitrary Java code on the server. This affects Cocoon 2.1 only
      (not the 2.0.x versions).
      As of 2003-09-03, this hole has been fixed in the latest CVS and a new version will be
      released very soon. In the meantime, if you use XMLForm or JXForms, we urge you to update
      the following source files and rebuild your Cocoon distribution:
    </note>
      <ul>
       <li>XMLForm - in <code>src/blocks/xmlform/java/org/apache/cocoon/components/xmlform</code>:
            update <link href="http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/cocoon-2.1/src/blocks/xmlform/java/org/apache/cocoon/components/xmlform/Form.java?rev=1.6">Form.java</link>
       </li>
        <li>JXForms - in <code>src/blocks/jxforms/java/org/apache/cocoon/components/jxforms/xmlform</code>:
            update <link href="http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/cocoon-2.1/src/blocks/jxforms/java/org/apache/cocoon/components/jxforms/xmlform/Form.java?rev=1.4">Form.java</link>

    <s1 title="What is Cocoon?">
      <p>
        Apache Cocoon is a web development framework built around the concepts of
        separation of concerns (making sure people can interact and collaborate on a
        project, without stepping on each other toes) and component-based web
        development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cocoon implements these concepts around the notion of 'component pipelines',
        each component on the pipeline specializing on a particular operation. This
        makes it possible to use a Lego(tm)-like approach in building web solutions,
        hooking together components into pipelines without any required programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cocoon is "<em>web glue for your web application development needs</em>". It
        is a glue that keeps concerns separate and allows parallel evolution of the
        two sides, improving development pace and reducing the chance of conflicts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cocoon has been designed to coexist and interoperate side-by-side with your
        existing J2EE solutions or to give them new functionality without requiring
        any change in the existing infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cocoon interacts with many data sources, including filesystems, RDBMS,
        LDAP, native XML databases, SAP&#174; systems and network-based data sources. 
        It adapts content delivery to the capabilities of different devices like HTML, WML,
        PDF, SVG, and RTF, to name just a few. You can run Cocoon as a Servlet as well as
        through a powerful, commandline interface. The deliberate design of its abstract 
        environment gives you the freedom to extend its functionality to meet your 
        special needs in a highly modular fashion.
