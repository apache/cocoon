      confusing, otherwise. What do you think?</fixme>
      <fixme author="HB">Will do so when I can find the time.</fixme>

      <p>First, we need to create our own form pages in XML.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Create a folder called &#34;howto&#34; in
        src\webapp\sample\xmlform.</li>

        <li>Create and copy the following xml files, as instructed below, and
        save them in the folder you created.</li>
      </ul>

      <s2 title="start.xml">
        <p>Here is the first page. Copy and save as start.xml in the folder
        src\webapp\mount\xmlform\howto.</p>

        <p>The text between &#34;cocoon-action-&#34; and &#34;=true&#34; is
        passed to the method prepare of HowtoWizardAction.java (to be written
        in step 4). In the above case, the value to be passed is
        &#34;start&#34;. This command, &#34;start&#34;, will reset the state of 
        the form by removing any remaining form values.</p>
      </s2>

      <p>The remaining XML pages are listed below in order:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>registration.xml</li>
        <li>interest.xml</li>
        <li>organicGardening.xml</li>
        <li>cooking.xml</li>
        <li>smallholding.xml</li>
        <li>confirm.xml</li>
        <li>end.xml</li>
      </ul>

      <s2 title="registration.xml">

        <p>registration.xml lets the user register a username, password and
        email address in order to join the mailing lists (chosen next).</p>
        
        <p>XMLForms has the ability to choose the scope of form persistence 
        to be either per-session or per-request.  This is selected in the 
        xmlform-scope parameter when the action is set up in the sitemap.   
        In forms that span multiple screens, you will always want to use  
        per-session.  Additionally, multiple forms can be active at once.  
        The xf:form&#39;s id attribute is the discriminator that allows this 
        functionality. </p>
	<p> It is mentioned early because this discriminator is also required 
        in the form source themselves. Our session identifier (as seen in  
        registration.xml below in the xf:form element), form-feedback, is 
        matched by the sitemap&#39;s map:parameter name-value pair shown here:</p>        

        <source>
      
       &#60;map:parameter name=&#34;xmlform-id&#34; value=&#34;form-feedback&#34;/&#62;
       
      </source>

        <p>The view attribute of the xf:form element should contain the name of 
        the current xml file. As it is used by the form action
        to determine which page was submitted, mapping the data on the form to
        current logic in the action. The name of the view should simply be 
        unique within the form, but it is most convenient to name the view after
        the base of the filename. So in this case, we will name our view 
        &#34;registration&#34;. In step 4 static string constants are used to unify
        the naming and allow for easier maintenance </p>

        <p>The action attribute should contain the URL you are using in
        the sitemap. When implementing, it is easier to put all your pages for a 
        given form in a single folder but have the relative URL the same between 
        the different folders. This allows a single sitemap template to be used for
        each of your different forms if desired. The URL is encoded directly to the 
        HTML action that is generated, so if this parameter is incorrect you will see
        a &#34;Resource Not Found&#34; error from Cocoon 2.</p>
 
        <p>The caption element is the page heading. Following that, we have error
        elements which are used if you have validation set in your sitemap.
        When an error is found, the error text will be displayed once the user
        clicks the next button on your form.</p>

        <p>Next we see the input options for the user, such as xf:textbox,
        which will display a textbox. Each of these options has a very
        important ref attribute whose value is mapped to the JavaBean.
        If you are validating this input then it must have a violations 
        element inside it. The violations element serves as a container 
        or place holder for validation errors. It has a single optional 
        attribute &#34;class&#34; which refers to the CSS class to use when 
        displaying validation errors.</p>
        
        <p>The format of the ref item is XPath, and the mapping is through
        <link href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/jxpath/">JXPath</link>.
        JXPath is very flexible, it is beyond the scope of this document to 
        describe it in detail.</p>

        <p>Finally, the form needs a submit element This enables the user to 
        continue on through the rest of the form.</p>

        It is very similar to the previous page which contained three tick
        boxes. The user has the choice of moving forward through the form or
        back to the previous page to adjust their areas of interest. This is decided 
        in the perform method of HowtoWizardAction.java.</p>
        <p>In a MVC pattern, it's clear to see that the form action is the controller, 
        dealing only with the logic behind the presentation.  The pages that we are 
        discussing here are the views, and the model is the bean that is describe 
        in step 3.</p>

       <p>The final confirmation page is generated by querying the model 
       bean and displaying it.  This is accomplished using the xf:output 
       element which specifies what value to display with the ref attribute,
       again in JXPath syntax.</p>
       <p>It's interesting to note that because this is a bean, business 
       logic could be embedded in the bean. So if this were a shopping cart 
       bean, we could have read-only business methods such as getTotalCost(), 
       which would be the sum of the individual item costs plus calculated 
       costs such as shipping and tax. You would have no problem displaying 
       that information on the form since the xf:output simply needs a JXPath 
       expression to query those methods. In such an example, the perform 
       method could be used to transactionally add the cart to the order 
       queue.</p>
