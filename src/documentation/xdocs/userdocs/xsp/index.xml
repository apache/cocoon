 <s1 title="Overview">

  <p>
    Here will soon appear an overview of the user perspective of XSP.   
  </p>

  <p>The actual user documentation is available from the side-panel.

  <s1 title="XSP learning map">
    <p>As I find that there is enough information about XSP available (only
      not together), I give you a list of pointers in the sequence you should read
      them.</p> 
    <ol>
      <li>Get Cocoon <link href="../../installing/index.html">up and running</link>. Surf
    to <code>[webhost]/cocoon/slides/slides?section=4</code> and following. This
    gives you a first insight in the XSP ground idea.</li>
    <li>Read the XSP Logicsheets page. This tells you how to use and make
      your own XSP logicsheets and XSP pages.</li>
    <li>If you're still hungry for more, read the XSP Internals page. This
      describes how XSP's are handled internally by Cocoon.</li>
    </ol>
