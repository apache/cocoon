         <s1 title="XSP learning map">
                <p>As I find that there is enough information about XSP available (only
                  not together), I give you a list of pointers in the sequence you should read
                  them.</p> 
                <ol>
                  <li>Get Cocoon <link href="../../installing/index.html">up and running</link>. Surf
                to <code>[webhost]/cocoon/slides/slides?section=4</code> and following. This
                gives you a first insight in the XSP ground idea.</li>
                <li>Read the XSP Logicsheets page. This tells you how to use and make
                  your own XSP logicsheets and XSP pages.</li>
                <li>If you're still hungry for more, read the XSP Internals page. This
                  describes how XSP's are handled internally by Cocoon.</li>
