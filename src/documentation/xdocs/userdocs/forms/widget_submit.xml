    <s1 title="submit widget">
      <p>The submit widget, usually rendered as a button, is used by
      the user to submit the form. The submit widget is a special kind
      of action widget, thus also has the same functionality as an action
      widget, however the submit widget does trigger validation and its
      purpose is to end the form.</p>

      <source><![CDATA[<fd:submit id="..." action-command="..." validate="true|false">
  <fd:label>...</fd:label>
  <fd:help>...</fd:help>
  <fd:hint>...</fd:hint>
  <fd:on-action>
    ...
  </fd:on-action>
</fd:submit>]]></source>

      <p>The optional attribute validate, which is true by default, can
      be used to disable validation. The difference between an action
      widget and a submit widget with validate="false" is that a submit
      widget with validate="false" will end form processing, thus the form
      will not be redisplayed (ultimately, it is of course the controller
      who decides this, but the forms hint towards the controller is that
      it shouldn't be redisplayed, and this is exactly what the flowscript
      integration library does).</p>
