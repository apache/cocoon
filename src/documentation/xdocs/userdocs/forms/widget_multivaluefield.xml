    <title>Cocoon Forms: multivaluefield widget</title>

    <s1 title="Concept">
      <p>The fd:multivaluefield is similar to the
      <link href="widget_field.html">field widget</link> but
      can take multiple values. Its purpose is to handle those (HTML) form
      controls which submit their multiple values as multiple (HTTP) request parameters
      with the same name. A multivaluefield should always have
      an fd:datatype element combined with a fd:selection-list, since
      the user will have to select values from this list.</p>

      <p>The fd:multivaluefield could be rendered as a list of checkboxes
      or as a listbox in which the user can select multiple items.
      The CForms stylesheets also include a styling option to render
      them as a "double list", i.e. a list of available and selected
      values.</p>

      <p>The setValue and getValue methods of the multivaluefield take
      respectively return arrays of objects (i.e. Object[]). The type
      of the objects in these arrays should match the datatype declared
      for the widget.</p>
    </s1>

      <source><![CDATA[<fd:multivaluefield id="...">
  <fd:label>...</fd:label>
  <fd:help>...</fd:help>
  <fd:hint>...</fd:hint>
  <fd:datatype base="...">
    [...]
  </fd:datatype>
  <fd:selection-list>
    [...]
  </fd:selection-list>
  <fd:validation>
    [...]
  </fd:validation>
  <fd:on-value-changed>
     [...]
  </fd:on-value-changed>
</fd:multivaluefield>]]></source>

      <p>Most of the elements and attributes have the same meaning
      as for the <link href="widget_field.html">field</link> widget.</p>

      <p>Note: A multivaluefield cannot have a required attribute,
      instead you should use the value-count validation rule to
      check the number of values the user has selected.</p>
