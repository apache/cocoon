    <s1 title="output widget">
      <p>An fd:output widget is similar to a field widget, but its value
      is not editable. The value of an output widget must be set programmatically
      (or through binding). An output widget does not read its value from
      the request, so is most useful in the case where the form is stored
      accross requests (e.g. as part of a flowscript or flow-apple). An
      output widget does not perform any validation, it is always considered
      to be valid.</p>

      <source><![CDATA[<fd:output id="...">
  <fd:label>...</fd:label>
  <fd:help>...</fd:help>
  <fd:hint>...</fd:hint>
  <fd:datatype base="...">
     [...]
  </fd:datatype>
</fd:output>]]></source>

      <p>Note: since the fd:output widget only serves as an equivalent of
      fd:field, it has been suggested that it would be better to add a
      "read-only" capability to all widgets.</p>

      <p>Note: on each widget you can also store additional information
      (i.e. arbitrary Java objects) in attributes. See the Java API
      of the Widget interface, methods setAttribute and getAttribute.</p>
