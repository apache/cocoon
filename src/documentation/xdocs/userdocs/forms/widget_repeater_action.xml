    <s1 title="repeater-action widget">
      <p>This is a specific type of action widget that handles the much
      needed case of adding or removing rows from a repeater.</p>

      <source><![CDATA[<fd:repeater-action id="..." action-command="delete-rows|add-row" repeater="..." select="...">
  <fd:label>...</fd:label>
  <fd:help>...</fd:help>
  <fd:hint>...</fd:hint>
  <fd:on-activate>
    ...
  </fd:on-activate>
</fd:repeater-action>]]></source>

      <p>The <strong>action-command</strong> attribute should have either
      the value <code>delete-rows</code> or <code>add-row</code>. If
      <strong>add-row</strong> is specified, the attribute repeater is required.
      If <strong>delete-rows</strong> is specified, both the repeater and
      select attributes are required.</p>

      <p>The <strong>repeater</strong> attribute should contain the id of the repeater widget
      on which this repeater-action should act. This must be a sibling of
      the repeater-action widget (see also row-action for actions inside a row).</p>

      <p>The <strong>select</strong> attribute should contain the id of the
      booleanfield widget (or any type of widget who's getValue() method
      returns a boolean) that is part of the repeater and used to mark
      the rows to be deleted.</p>

      <p><strong>fd:on-activate</strong> allows additional event handlers
      to be defined, see also <link href="eventhandling.html">Event Handling</link>. The interface to be
      implemented for Java event listeners is <code>org.apache.cocoon.forms.event.ActionListener</code>.
      The WidgetEvent subclass is <code>org.apache.cocoon.forms.event.ActionEvent</code>.</p>
