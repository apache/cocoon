    <title>Cocoon Forms: row-action widget</title>

    <s1 title="Concept">
      <p>This is a specific type of <link href="widget_action.html">action widget</link>
      that handles frequent actions
      occuring on a repeater row, such as adding/removing a row and moving
      it up and down. These widgets should be placed inside a repeater and
      act on the current row.</p>
    </s1>

    <s1 title="Configuration">
      <source><![CDATA[<fd:row-action id="..." action-command="add-after|delete|move-up|move-down">
  <fd:label>...</fd:label>
  <fd:help>...</fd:help>
  <fd:hint>...</fd:hint>
  <fd:on-activate>
    ...
  </fd:on-activate>
</fd:row-action>]]></source>

      <p>The <strong>action-command</strong> attribute should have either the
      value <code>add-after</code>, <code>delete</code>, <code>move-up</code>
      or <code>move-down</code>.</p>

      <p><strong>fd:on-activate</strong> allows additional event handlers to
      be defined, see also <link href="eventhandling.html">Event Handling</link>. The interface to be implemented
      for Java event listeners is <code>org.apache.cocoon.forms.event.ActionListener</code>.
      The WidgetEvent subclass is <code>org.apache.cocoon.forms.event.ActionEvent</code>.</p>

      <p>Where all you want to do is submit a specific row on a repeater,
      simply add a fd:submit element to the widgets for the repeater.</p>

      <p>Then, you can access the submitted row either using an event handler
      with event.getSourceWidget().getParent(), or from the flow using
      form.getWidget().getSubmitWidget().getParent(). The row itself has a
      getWidget(widgetName) method that can be used to access specific
      widgets for the row.</p>
