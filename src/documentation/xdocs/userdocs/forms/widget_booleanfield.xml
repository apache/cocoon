    <s1 title="Concept">
      <p>An fd:booleanfield is a field that has a value of
      true or false. Usually is rendered as a checkbox.</p>

      <p>It is different from a <link href="widget_field.html">field widget</link>
      with a <code>boolean</code> datatype because an HTML checkbox submits
      no request parameter if the checkbox is unchecked. If you would render
      it instead as a listbox with true and false values, you could also
      use a regular field widget. Since the styling preference might change over
      time, it is however better to use consistently the fd:booleanfield widget.</p>

      <p>A booleanfield cannot be marked as "required", because it is
      always required. It is either true or false. If you want tripples
      (true/false/none), use a normal field widget with a selection list.</p>
