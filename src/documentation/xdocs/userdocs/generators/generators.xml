    <s1 title="Goal">
     <p>This document lists all of the available generators of Apache Cocoon and describes their
       purpose.</p>
    </s1>
    <s1 title="Overview">
      <p>A generator is the starting point of an xml pipeline. It generates XML content as SAX
        events and initializes pipeline processing. Every pipeline match containing a generator
        must be terminated by a serializer.
      </p>
      <p>In the sitemap file, each generator has a unique name which is mapped to a Java class. One
        generator name must be declared as the default generator. Each generator may have additional
        configuration information specified in child elements.
      </p>
      <p>On the left you see all generators that are available in Cocoon. The list is separated into
        the core generators, belonging to the Cocoon core, and optional generators that are part of
        specific blocks.
      </p>        
      <p>For conceptual information on generators see the user's guide document
        <link href="../concepts/sitemap.html">The Sitemap</link>.
