		<s1 title="Warning!">
      <p>
        The XML:DB generators are currently unmaintained and going to be 
        deprecated soon. Please use the XML:DB pseudo-protocol instead.
      </p>

		<s1 title="XML:DB Generator">
			<p>
         Generates XML documents out of an XML:DB compliant database. XML:DB
         is a generic API developed by the XML:DB group in order to allow access
         via a consistent API to the upcoming XML databases such as dbXML,
         Ozone and eXist (as of now only the first one has an almost compliant
         API implementation).
         For the sake of this document, an XML:DB compliant database can be 
         seen as a filesystem where directories are called "collections" and 
         files are called "resources".
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Name: xmldb</li>
        <li>Class: org.apache.cocoon.generation.XMLDBGenerator</li>
        <li>Cacheable: no</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
         The generator needs to be configured in a "JDBCish" way: a driver 
         (a class name) must be provided, together with a "base" URI. An example
         configuration, based on the stock dbXML implementation, will look like 
         this:
      </p>
<source><![CDATA[
<map:generator name="xmldb"
               src="org.apache.cocoon.generation.XMLDBGenerator"
               label="content">
  <driver>org.dbxml.client.xmldb.DatabaseImpl</driver>
  <base>xmldb:dbxml:///db/</base>
</map:generator>
]]></source>
      <p>
         Note that the content of the "base" tag will be prepended to the 
         requested resource. It's important to keep a trailing slash at the
         end of the <code>base</code> tag.
      </p>
