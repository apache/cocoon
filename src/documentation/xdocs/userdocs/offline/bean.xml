	 <s1 title="Overview">
		<p>The Cocoon Bean provides a Java programmatic interface for embedding Cocoon into other
		   applications.
		</p>
	 </s1>
	 <s1 title="Details">
       <p>At present, the bean is mainly used for offline page generation. However, there is no 
          reason why it should only be used in offline applications.</p>
       <p>An example of an application that uses the bean is the Cocoon Command Line Interface (CLI). 
          To find more about using the bean, look at the code for the CLI, which can be found 
          in the Cocoon codebase in <code>src/java</code>, in the class 
          <code>org.apache.cocoon.Main</code>.</p>
       <note>Whilst the Cocoon Bean works, it is still under development, and therefore its API
             must be considered unstable. Return to this page in future versions to see what has 
             changed.</note>
