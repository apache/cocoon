    <s1 title="Tutorial: A Gentle Introduction to Cocoon Control Flow">
      <p>In this tutorial, we will create a simple number guessing game using
         Cocoon's Control Flow engine.</p>
      <p>After you have Cocoon 2.1 deployed and running, go to where you have
        Cocoon deployed and create a new subdirectory named <code>game</code>.
        Cocoon's default main sitemap will automatically mount the sitemap in
        the subdirectory.</p>
      <p>Create the following <code>sitemap.xmap</code> in the new subdirectory:</p>

      <p>Inside the new subdirectory, create two more directories,
        <code>documents/</code> and <code>flow/</code>.</p>
      <p>Inside <code>documents/</code>, you will store the "views" -- pages to
        send to the player. Create the file <code>guess.jxt</code>, which will
        be the page the player will enter their guess:</p>
      <source><![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<html xmlns:jx="http://apache.org/cocoon/templates/jx/1.0">

  <title>cocoon flow number guessing game</title>

  <h1>Guess the Number Between 1 and 10</h1>
  <h2>${hint}</h2>
  <h3>You've guessed ${guesses} times.</h3>
  <form method="post" action="${continuation.id}.kont">
    <input type="text" name="guess"/>
    <input type="submit"/>
  </form>
</body>
</html>
]]></source>
      <p>
        You'll also need a page to display when the person chooses the correct
        number. Name it <code>success.jxt</code> (Again in <code>documents/</code>):

  <h1>Success!</h1>
  <h2>The number was: ${random}</h2>
  <h3>It took you ${guesses} tries.</h3>
  <p><a href="./">Play again</a></p>
</body>
</html>
]]></source>
      <p>
        You may notice some strange codes inside the files -- namely things like
        <code>${random}</code> and <code>${guesses}</code>. They look like
        variables and they will be replaced with values when the pages are
        sent to the client. This is where the
        <link href="jxtemplate.html">JXTemplateGenerator</link> comes in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside <code>flow/</code> you will store the code that actually controls
        how this application runs. In the "MVC" pattern the Flow is the
        "Controller" and it is very powerful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Create the following file named <code>game.js</code>:
      </p>
      <source><![CDATA[
function main() {

  var random =  Math.round( Math.random() * 9 ) + 1;

  var hint = "No hint for you!"
  var guesses = 0;

  while (true) {

    cocoon.sendPageAndWait("guess.jxt", { "random" : random, "hint" : hint,
                                          "guesses" : guesses} );

    var guess = parseInt( cocoon.request.get("guess") );
    guesses++;

    if (guess) {
      if (guess > random) {
        hint = "Nope, lower!"
      } else if (guess < random) {
        hint = "Nope, higher!"
      } else {
        break;
      }
    }
  }

  cocoon.sendPage("success.jxt", {"random" : random, "guess" : guess,
                                  "guesses" : guesses} );
}
]]></source>
      <p>
        Alright, now let's follow the execution of this Flow and pipeline: The
        player accesses the URL <code>http://host/cocoon/game/</code> and the
        &lt;map:match pattern=""&gt; matches, and starts the pipeline.
      </p>
      <p>
        The function <code>main()</code> which is referenced in
        <code>flow/game.js</code> is called and a new Continuation object is
        created. Without getting into too much detail the state of the Javascript
        code is saved and can be recalled any number of times.
      </p>
      <p>We now enter the code in <code>game.js</code>:</p>
      <p>A random number between 1 and 10 is chosen.</p>
      <p>
        Variables containing a hint for the player and the player's current
        number of guesses are initialized. The Flow now enters the
        <code>while(true)</code> loop which basically keeps the game going until
        the player guesses the correct number.
      </p>
      <p>We now get to the following line, where things start to get interesting:</p>
      <source>
cocoon.sendPageAndWait("guess.jxt", { "random" : random, "hint" : hint, "guesses" : guesses} );
</source>
      <p>
        The Flow layer sends the contents of the URI "guess.jxt" which is matched
        in the sitemap (see above). We also pass an inline Javascript object,
        containing three key/value pairs, one named "random" which contains the
        value of the variable random as initialized above, and so on for hint and
        guesses. The keys are substituted later down the line, when the
        <code>JXTemplateGenerator</code> comes into play.
      </p>
      <p>We could also do the following:</p>
      <source>
cocoon.sendPageAndWait("guess.jxt", { "foo" : random } );
</source>
      <p>
        In this case, the value of random would be able to be substituted in our
        JXTemplate, but under the name "foo" instead -- we'd just have to make
        sure we have the correct keyname in our template.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Flow Layer also does another interesting thing: it halts the
        execution of the Javascript! Through the magic of continuations the Flow
        Layer is able to resume execution of the script at the exact line in
        which it left off. This creates some very powerful situations with
        respect to web programming, and forces the reader to think very
        differently about how web applications are designed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Picking back up in the script execution, the client is sent through
        the pipeline matching "guess.jxt". Referring back to the sitemap, we
        match *.jxt, and run the file through the JXTemplateGenerator, which
        substitutes the keynames for the values sent from the
        <link href="api.html#sendPageAndWait">cocoon.sendPageAndWait()</link>
        function.
      </p>
      <p>
        One thing to note is in the form which is sent back to Cocoon when the
        player submits the guess:
      </p>
      <source><![CDATA[
<form method="post" action="${continuation.id}.kont">
]]></source>
      <p>
        Here, ${continuation.id} is resolved to a unique identifier which points
        to the current continuation. One can think of this somewhat of a session ID.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the player submits the form, it is submitted to a unique URL which
        contains the continuation ID, plus ".kont", which we end up matching in
        the sitemap:
      </p>
      <source><![CDATA[
<map:match pattern="*.kont">
  <map:call continuation="{1}"/>
</map:match>
]]></source>
      <p>
        When Cocoon sees a URL like this, it attempts to restart the continuation
        with the specified ID and we re-enter the Javascript code where we left
        off previously.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are now back in the Javascript at the line after
        <link href="api.html#sendPageAndWait">sendPageAndWait()</link>. We create
        a new variable (an int), which we get from the POST request that was sent
        by the form. Notice in the form we had
        <code>&lt;input type="text" name="guess"/&gt;</code> and in the Javascript
        we get the request parameter by using <code>cocoon.request.get("guess");</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now we increment the player's guess count and we test to see if they
        guessed the correct number. If the guess was too high, we set the hint
        variable telling them to guess lower, we fall through the bottom of
        the while loop and we send the guess form back to the player.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the guess was too low, we tell them to guess higher, we fall through
        the loop as well sending the player the form again.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the guess was correct, we break out of the main loop and send the
        player to a different view, this time to "success.jxt", and we give the
        template not only their number and the random number (pointless, yes,
        because they were the same), but also the number of guesses to tell the
        player how good or bad at guessing numbers they are.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main point of interest in the Flow script at this point is the use of
        <code>sendPage()</code> instead of <code>sendPageAndWait()</code>.
        <code>sendPage()</code> works exactly the same, except, yes, you guessed
        it, we don't halt execution of code and keep processing.
      </p>
      <p>At this point there's no more code left and the game is over and the Flow stops.</p>
      <p>
        Another thing to note is the &lt;map:handle-errors&gt; tag in the sitemap.
        Previously, when a continuation which did not exist was called, the Flow
        layer would automatically redirect to the URI "invalidContinuation". Now,
        the Flow layer throws an <code>InvalidContinuationException</code> and
        you can now handle it as described in the handle-errors tag.
      </p>
      <p>
        And that's it! You have now just made your very first application using
        the Flow layer.
