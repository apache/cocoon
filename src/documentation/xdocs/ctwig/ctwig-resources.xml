			<s2 title="Apache Cocoon Web Site">
				<p>The main place is <link href="http://cocoon.apache.org/"><code>http://cocoon.apache.org/</code></link></p>
				<p>The C2 documentation is still (and always will be) under development. There is a lot of useful information there and it goes into a lot more detail than here.  Read it and digest it.  I am certainly doing that as I go along and quite quickly understanding more of the architecture and concepts.  I will seek to distill the main points into this site, but the main place is still the supplied documentation.</p>
				<p>You will also find the documentation in your C2 installation under {COCOON_HOME}/docs/</p>

			<s2 title="Apache Cocoon Users Mail List">
				<p><link href="mailto:cocoon-users-subscribe@xml.apache.org">Subscribe</link> to the Cocoon users mail list!  This is a great resource for asking and answering questions.
