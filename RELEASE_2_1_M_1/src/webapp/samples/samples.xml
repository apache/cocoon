  <group name="The Power of XML">
   <sample name="Hello World!" href="hello-world/">
    The complete separation between content and style
    leads to a very powerful multi-channeling solution where you can
    apply different stylesheets to the same content and generate different
    flavors of it.
   </sample>
   <sample name="XML-ized web sites" href="sites/">
    A couple of existing web sites have been xml-ized to show you
    how easier it is to handle content-pure markup.
   </sample>   
   <sample name="Internationalization (i18n) &amp; Localization (l10n)" href="i18n/">
    Since XML is based on Unicode, it can be used to encode all types of
    languages. Here is an example of the power of such an approach with
    the help of those i18n and l10n Cocoon facilities.
   </sample>
   <sample name="Syndication and Content Aggregation" href="aggregation/">
    Separation of content and style allows not only to serve your content
    in different ways, but also to syndicate, aggregate or otherwise transform
    content provided by other web sites.
   </sample>
   <sample name="Slides" href="slides/slides">
    An example of more complex use of XSTL for navigation and content filtering.
   </sample>   
   <sample name="Resource Catalog" href="catalog/">
    XML is handy but also very complex. Cocoon integrates a number of 
    facilities to help you during your journey thru XML-land. One of these
    is the centralized handling of resolving network resources 
    (e.g. DTDs, symbols, character entity sets, images) to local copies thru
    the use of catalogs.
   </sample>
  </group>
 
  <group name="Web Services">
   <sample name="SOAP" href="soap/">
     Cocoon ships with facilities for immediate connection to SOAP resources.
     These examples show you how to connect to any web service with a few
     lines of XML markup.
   </sample>

  <group name="Web Site Syndication">
    <sample name="Examples" href="webserviceproxy/">
    Demonstrates how to embed One Web Site functionality
    in Another. Using the WebServiceProxyGenerator remote web app
    integration is easy.
    </sample>
    <sample name="Virtual Portal Demo" href="webserviceproxy/cocoonhive/">
    A more sophisticated example including Amazon and OpenWiki. 
    Shows how a personalized
    portal can be built by connecting multiple remote
    services without writing a single line of business logic code.
    Only styling is used in addition to the proxy.

   <sample name="Status Page" href="status.html">
    This page shows the current internal status of cocoon, along with
    information on the cache and the object stores.

   <sample name="Clear Persistent Store" href="clearpersistentstore.html">
    Empties the Cocoon persistent store.

   <sample name="Request Page" href="request.html">
    This example shows the usage of the RequestGenerator.

   <sample name="Error Page" href="generror.html">
    This example shows what happens if an error is triggered in the pipeline.
   </sample>
  <sample name="Link Status" href="linkstatus">
    Verify that there are no broken hyperlinks in the local Cocoon
    documentation. This sample will start at the home page of the local
    documentation webapp and traverse each internal link, reporting its status
    in a colour-coded table. Be patient - this process will take a while.
    NOTE: this will work only if you have included the documentation when 
    you built the web application
