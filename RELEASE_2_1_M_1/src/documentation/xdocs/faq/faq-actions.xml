  <question>
   What is an Action?
  </question>
  <answer>
  <p>
An Action is a sitemap component that manipulates runtime parameters based on request and application state. An Action's result is available in the sitemap as map of name/value pairs. Detailed information on actions may be found in <link href="../userdocs/concepts/actions.html">Creating and Using Actions</link>.

  <question>Why does Cocoon return an error when I add an action to a pipeline?</question>
  <answer>
  <p>The pipeline was working fine before the action was added. After
  the change, Cocoon seems unable to find the file specified in the
  variable that is returned by the matcher.</p>

<source><![CDATA[
<map:match pattern="*">
  <map:act type="validate-session">
    <map:generate type="serverpages" src="{../1}.xsp"/>
  </map:act>
  <map:serialize/>
</map:match>
]]></source>

  <p>Please note in the above example the "<em><code>../1</code></em>".</p> 
  <p>Map objects returned from matchers and actions are organised
  <em>hierarchically</em>. Therefore, old map objects are not replaced by new ones,
  such as the map objects returned by the validate-session action above.
  Because older map objects are still accessible through a path expression, new ones are
  accessed differently. Here "<code>../1</code>" references key ( or "variable") "1" 
  in the next to last Map. </p>
