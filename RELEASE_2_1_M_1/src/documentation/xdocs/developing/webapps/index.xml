 <s1 title="Overview">
 <p>This section contains several documents about developing real-world web applications
  with Cocoon.</p>
 <p>Some of these concepts are currently in development. The development of the
  <link href="session.html">Session handling</link>, the 
  <link href="authentication.html">authentication</link> framework and
  the <link href="portal.html">portal framework</link> is nearly finished. You will
  find these components in the latest CVS version of Cocoon. The documentation
  listed in the menu conforms to the current CVS version.</p>
 <p>However, the current release @released.version@ contains alpha versions in the
   scratchpad area of these three components. So you can already have a look at them. The
   documentation in the "scratchpad" folder contains the description conforming to the
   scratchpad. But be warned that they are in the scratchpad area and will change in 
   upcomming releases. So if you are really planning to use them, have a look at the
   latest CVS.
