your newly acquired skills...

}}}

!Writing text

You don't need to know anything about the Wiki text formatting rules to use Wiki.  Just write normal text, and then use
an empty line to mark a paragraph.
It's just like writing an email.

You can always Edit this page (look at the left sidebar) to see how the different
effects on this page are used.

!Hyperlinks
The link can also be a direct URL starting with http:, ftp:, mailto:, https:, or news:, in which case the link points to
an external entity. For example, to point at the java.sun.com home page, use [[http://java.sun.com], which becomes
[http://java.sun.com/] or [[Java home page|http://java.sun.com], which becomes [Java home page|http://java.sun.com].

To add a new page you just create a link to it from somewhere else. After all, there isn't much point in having a page
if you can't access it! You'll then see a small question mark after the page name when you return to that page. Then
click on it and you have created a new page!

It's allowed to use almost any kind of characters inside a [WikiName], as long
as they are letters or numbers.

Note also that this Wiki can be configured to support standard CamelCase linking (if it's supported, the word CamelCase
should be a link).  It's off by default, but if your friendly administrator has turned it on, then well, CamelCase all
you want =).

!Footnotes

These are a special kind of hyperlink.  By using nothing but a number inside
a hyperlink you create a reference to a footnote, like this [[1], which 
creates a footnote[1].  To make the actual footnote, you just put a [[#1]
where you want that footnote to point at.  Look below to find the footnote.

You can also make a named footnote, just as if you were doing a normal hyperlink.  For example, this refers to the same
footnote[Footnote number 1|1] as the footnote above, but this refers to another footnote[2].

!InterWiki links

You can also do links between different Wikis without knowing the URL.  Just use a link in the form [[Wiki:WikiPage] and
JSPWiki will create a link for you.  For example, this link points to the [JSPWiki TextFormatting
rules|JSPWiki:TextFormattingRules]. Check the [SystemInfo] page for more information on which Wiki links are available.

If an InterWiki link is not supported, you'll get a notification of it on the page when
you save your page.

!Adding pictures

For security reasons uploading images is not permitted, but you can embed
any image in the wiki code by putting the image available somewhere on the web in one of the allowed formats, and then
just linking to it.
For example, this is an inlined [PNG] image: [http://www.ecyrd.com/~jalkanen/test.png].

If you specify a link text ([[this one here|http://example.com/example.png]) it becomes
the ALT text for those who either can't or don't want to view images.

The list of accepted image types depends on the Wiki.  See the [SystemInfo]
page for a list of the different image types.

!Bulleted lists
Use an asterisk (*) in the first column to make bulleted lists. Use more asterisks for deeper indentation. For example:
{{{
* One
* Two
* Three
** Three.One
}}}

creates
* One
* Two
* Three
** Three.One

!Numbered lists
Just like with bulleted lists, but use a hash (#) instead of the asterisk. Like this:
{{{
# One
# Two
# Three
## Three.One
}}}

creates
# One
# Two
# Three
## Three.One

If you want to write the list item on multiple lines, just add one or more spaces on the next line and the line will be
automatically added to the
previous item.  If this sounds complicated, edit this page for an example, below.

* This is a single-line item.
* This is actually a multi-line item.
  We continue the second sentence on a line on a line of its own.
  We might as well do a third line while we're at it...
  Notice, however, as all these sentences get put inside a single item!
* The third line is again a single-line item for your convinience.

!Definition lists and comments

A simple way to make definition lists is to use the ';:' -construct:

;__Construct__:''Something you use to do something with''

Another nice use for the ';:' is that you can use it to comment shortly on other people's text, by having an empty
'term' in the definition, like this:
{{{
;:''Comment here.''
}}}
Which would be seen as
;:''Comment here.''

!Text effects

You may use __bold__ text or ''italic'' text, by using two underscores (_) and two single quotes ('), respectively. If
you're on a Windows computer, make sure that you are using the correct quote sign, as there is one that looks the same,
but really isn't.


!Preformatted text

If you want to add preformatted text (like code) just use three consecutive braces ({) to open a block, and three
consecutive braces (}) to close a block. Edit this page for an example.

!Tables

You can do simple tables by using using pipe signs ('|').  Use double pipe
signs to start the heading of a table, and single pipe signs to then
write the rows of the table.  End with a line that is not a table.

For example:

{{{
|| Heading 1 || Heading 2
| ''Gobble'' | Bar
| [Main]     | [SandBox]
}}}

gives you the following table.  Note how you can use links also inside tables.

|| Heading 1 || Heading 2
| ''Gobble'' | Bar
| [Main]     | [SandBox]


!Conflicts

If someone happens to edit the same page as you at the same time, JSPWiki will prevent you from doing changes and show a
conflict page instead. Sorry to say, but the first one to make changes wins...

__A word of warning:__ If you use the Back button of your browser to go into the Edit page, you will almost certainly
get a conflict. This is because the browser thinks its still editing an earlier copy of the page.

!Deleting pages

This is not possible. You can, of course, remove all the links to that page, which makes it inaccesible. Or you can
email the administrator, and I'll remove the page.

!Adding new pages

Create a link that points to a new (not existing) page using its [WikiName].
Click that new link, which should now have a question mark (?) suffix and
you will get an editor for the new page. -- [Asser]

!Attaching files

If the administrator of the wiki has configured it, there is a "Attach file..." link at the bottom of every page.
Clicking it allows you to attach files into pages.  For more information, please see [WikiAttachments].

!Inserting variables

There are many possible variables you can insert on a page.  The basic form is:

{{ [[{$variablename}], }}

where ''variablename'' is the name of the variable you want to insert.  Note that variable names are case-insensitive -
that is, "pagename" is the same as "paGeNamE" and "PageName".

You can see the list of available of variables at [WikiVariables].

!Inserting plugins

The basic incantation to insert a plugin looks like this:

[[{INSERT <plugin class> WHERE param1=value, param2=value, ...}]

There is more information in [JSPWikiPlugins].

[#1] Here's the footnote I mentioned.
