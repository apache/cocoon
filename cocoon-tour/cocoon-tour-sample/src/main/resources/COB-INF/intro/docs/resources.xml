            The main Cocoon web site is found at <a href="http://cocoon.apache.org">http://cocoon.apache.org</a>
            and contains links to the project's <em>mailing lists</em>, <em>CVS code repository</em> and other resources.
        </p>

        <p>
            An important source of information is the
            <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/cocoon">http://wiki.apache.org/cocoon</a> site, a Wiki containing lots of
            information which completes (and often overlaps) the official documentation.
        </p>

        <p>
            The <a href="../../../..">samples</a> provided with Cocoon
            will help to explore the functionality of the various blocks. The main
            website contains some <em>documentation tracks</em> which will help
            you analyze and understand the samples.
