/**
 * <p>Cocoon taglib allows developers to write custom iteration tags by
 * implementing the LoopTag interface.  (This is not to be confused with
 * org.apache.cocoon.taglib.IterationTag) 
 * LoopTag establishes a mechanism for iteration tags to be recognized
 * and for type-safe communication with custom subtags.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>Since most iteration tags will behave identically with respect to
 * actual iterative behavior, however, Cocoon taglib provides this
 * base support class to facilitate implementation.  Many iteration tags
 * will extend this and merely implement the hasNext() and next() methods
 * to provide contents for the handler to iterate over.</p>
 *
 * <p>In particular, this base class provides support for:</p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 *  <li> iteration control, based on protected next() and hasNext() methods
 *  <li> subsetting (begin, end, step functionality, including validation
 *       of subset parameters for sensibility)
 *  <li> item retrieval (getCurrent())
 *  <li> status retrieval (LoopTagStatus)
 *  <li> exposing attributes (set by 'var' and 'varStatus' attributes)
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>In providing support for these tasks, LoopTagSupport contains
 * certain control variables that act to modify the iteration.  Accessors
 * are provided for these control variables when the variables represent
 * information needed or wanted at translation time (e.g., var, status).  For
 * other variables, accessors cannot be provided here since subclasses
 * may differ on their implementations of how those accessors are received.
 * For instance, one subclass might accept a String and convert it into
 * an object of a specific type by using an expression evaluator; others
 * might accept objects directly.  Still others might not want to expose
 * such information to outside control.</p>
 * 
 * Migration from JSTL1.0
 * @see javax.servlet.jsp.jstl.core.LoopTagSupport
