<h1 align="center">Cocoon2</h1>

<p align="center">by Stefano Mazzocchi</p>

<h2 align="left">Introduction</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p align="left">The Cocoon Project has gone a long way since it's creation on
  January 1999. It started as a simple servlet for static XSL styling and became
  more and more powerful as new features were added. Unfortunately, design
  decisions made early in the project influenced its evolution. Today, some of
  those
  constraints that shaped the project were modified as XML standards have evolved and
  solidified. For this reason, those design decisions need to be reconsidered
  under this new light.</p>

  <p align="left">While Cocoon started as a small step in the direction of a new
  web publishing idea based on better design patterns and reviewed estimations
  of management issues, the technology used was not mature enough for tools to
  emerge. Today, most web engineers consider XML as the key for an improved web
  model and web site managers see XML as a way to reduce costs and ease
  production.</p>
  <p align="left">In an era where services rather than software will be key for
  economical success, a better and less expensive model for web publishing will
  be a winner, especially if based on open standards.</p>

</blockquote>

<h2 align="left">Passive APIs vs. Active APIs&nbsp;</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p align="left">Web serving environments must be fast and scalable to be
  useful. Cocoon1 was born as a &quot;proof of concept&quot; rather than a
  production software and had significant design restrictions based mainly on
  the availability of freely redistributable tools. Other issues were lack of
  detailed knowledge on the APIs available as well as underestimation of the
  project success, being created as a way to learn XSL rather than a full
  publishing system capable of taking care of all XML web publishing needs.</p>
  <p align="left">For the above reasons, Cocoon1 was based on the DOM level 1
  API which is a <i>passive</i> API and was intended mainly for client side
  operation. This is mainly due to the fact that most (if not all!) DOM
  implementations require the document to reside in memory. While this is
  practical for small documents and thus good for the &quot;proof of
  concept&quot; stage, it is now considered a main design constraint for Cocoon
  scalability.</p>
  <p align="left">Since the goal of Cocoon2 is the ability to process
  simultaneously multiple 100Mb documents in JVM with a few Mbs of heap size,
  careful memory use and tuning of internal components is a key issue. To reach
  this goal, an improved API model was needed. This is now identified in the SAX
  API which is, unlike DOM, event based (so <i>active</i>, in the sense that its
  design is based the <i>inversion of control</i> principle).</p>
  <p align="left">The event model allows document producers to trigger producing
  events that get handled in the various processing stages and get finally
  formatted in the response stream. This has significant impacts on performance
  and memory needs:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p align="left"><b>incremental operation</b>: the response is created
      during document production. Client's perceived performance is dramatically
      improved since clients can start receiving data as soon as it is created,
      not after all processing stages have been performed. In those cases where
      incremental operation is not possible (for example, element sorting),
      internal buffers store the events until the operation can be performed.
      However, even in these cases performance can be increased with the use of
      tuned memory structures.</li>
    <li>
      <p align="left"><b>lowered memory consumption</b>: since most of the
      server processing required in Cocoon is incremental, an incremental model
      allows XML production events to be transformed directly into output events
      and character written on streams, thus avoiding the need to store them in
      memory.</li>
    <li>
      <p align="left"><b>easier scalability</b>: reduce memory needs allow more
      concurrent operation to be possible, thus allowing the publishing system
      to scale as the load increases.</li>
    <li>
      <p align="left"><b>more optimizable code model</b>: modern virtual
      machines are based on the idea of <i>hot spots</i>, code fragments that
      are used often and, if optimized, increase the process execution by far.
      This new event model allows easier detection of hot spots since it's a
      method driven operation, rather than a memory driven one. Hot methods can
      be identified earlier and their optimization performed better.</li>
    <li>
      <p align="left"><b>reduced garbage collection</b>: even the most advanced
      and lightweight DOM implementation require at least three to five times
      (and sometimes much more than this) more memory than original document
      size. This does not only reduce the scalability of the operation, but also
      impact overall performance by increasing the number of memory garbage that
      must be collected after the response in sent to the client. Even if modern
      virtual machines reduced the overhead of garbage collection, less garbage
      will always have performance and scalability impacts.</li>
  </ul>
  <p align="left">The above points, alone, would be enough for the Cocoon2
  paradigm shift, even if this event based model impacts not only the general
  architecture of the publishing system but also its internal processing
  components such as XSLT processing and PDF formatting. These components will
  require substantial work and maybe design reconsideration to be able to follow
  a pure event-based model. The Cocoon Project will work closely with the other
  component projects to be able to influence their operation in this direction.&nbsp;</p>

</blockquote>

<h2 align="left">Reactors Reconsidered</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p align="left">Another design choice that should be revised is the reactor
  pattern that was introduced to allow components to be connected in more
  flexible way. In fact, opposed to the fixed pipe model used up to Cocoon
  1.3.1, the reactor approach allows components to be dynamically connected,
  depending on reaction instructions introduced inside the documents.</p>
  <p align="left">While this at first seemed a very advanced and highly
  appealing model, it turned out to be a very dangerous approach. The first
  concern is mainly technical: porting the reactor pattern under an event-based
  model requires limitations and tradeoffs since the generated events must be
  cached until a reaction instruction is encountered.</p>
  <p align="left">But even if the technical difficulties are solved, a key limitation
  remains: there is no single point of management.</p>

</blockquote>

<h2 align="left">Management Considerations</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p align="left">The web was created to reduce information management costs by
  distributing them back on information owners. While this model is great for
  user communities (scientists, students, employees, or people in general) each
  of them managing small amount of personal information, it becomes impractical
  for highly centralized information systems where distributed management is
  simply not practical.</p>
  <p align="left">While in the HTML web model the page format and URL names
  where the only necessary contracts between individuals to create a world wide
  web, in more structured information systems the number of contracts increases
  by a significant factor due to the need of increased coherence between the
  hosted information: common style, common design issues, common languages,
  server side logic integration, data validation, etc...</p>
  <p align="left">It is only under this light that XML and its web model reveal
  their power: the HTML web model had too little contracts to be able to develop
  a structured and more coherent distributed information system, reason that is
  mainly imposed by the lack of good and algorithmically certain information
  indexing and knowledge seeking. Lacks that tend to degrade the quality of the
  truly distributed web in favor of more structured web sites (that based their
  improved site structure on internal contracts).</p>
  <p align="left">The simplification and engineering of web site management is
  considered one of the most important Cocoon2 goals. This is done mainly by
  technologically imposing a reduced number of contracts and place them in a hierarchical
  shape suitable to replace current high-structure web site management
  models.&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left">The model that Cocoon2 adopts is the &quot;pyramid model of
  web contracts&quot; which is outlined in the picture below</p>
  <p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/pyramid-model.gif" alt="The Cocoon2 Pyramid Model of Contracts" width="313" height="159"></p>
  <p align="left">and is composed by four different working contexts (the
  rectangles)</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p align="left">Management: the people that decide what the site should
      contain, how it should behave and how it should appear</li>
    <li>
      <p align="left">Content: the people responsible to write, own and manage
      the site content. This context may contain several sub-contexts one&nbsp;
      for each language used to express page content.</li>
    <li>
      <p align="left">Logic: the people responsible for integration with dynamic
      content generation technologies and database systems.</li>
    <li>
      <p align="left">Style: the people responsible for information
      presentation, look &amp; feel, site graphics and its maintenance.</li>
  </ul>
  <p align="left">and five contracts contexts (the lines)</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p align="left">management - content</li>
    <li>
      <p align="left">management - logic</li>
    <li>
      <p align="left">management - style</li>
    <li>
      <p align="left">content - logic</li>
    <li>
      <p align="left">content - style</li>
  </ul>

</blockquote>

<h2 align="left">Overlapping contexts and Chain Mapping</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p align="left">The above model can be applied only if the different contexts
  never overlap, otherwise there is no chance of having a single management
  point. For example, if the W3C-recommended method to link stylesheets to XML
  documents is used, the content and style contexts overlap and it's impossible
  to change the styling behavior of the document without changing it. The same
  is true for the processing instructions used by the Cocoon1 reactor to drive
  the page processing: each stage concur to determine the result thus increasing
  management and debug complexity. Another overlapping in context contracts is
  the need for URL-encoded parameters to drive the page output. These overlaps
  break the pyramid model and increase the management costs.&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left">In Cocoon2, the reactor pattern will be abandoned in favor of
  a chain mapping technique. This is based on the fact that the number of
  different contracts is limited even for big sites (for example, even if the
  pages are millions, they probably all share no more than a few different DTDs
  and each DTD has no more than a couple of stylesheets).</p>
  <p align="left">Also, for performance reasons, Cocoon2 will try to compile
  everything that is possibly compilable (pages/XSP into producers, stylesheets
  into processors, etc...) so, in this new model, the <i>processing chain</i>
  that generates the page contains (in a direct executable form) all the
  information/logic that handles the requested resource to generate its
  response.</p>
  <p align="left">This means that instead of using even-driven request-time DTD
  interpretation (done in all Cocoon1 processors), these will be either compiled
  into processors directly (XSLT stylesheet compilation) or compiled into
  producers using logicsheets and XSP which will remove totally the need for
  request-time interpretation solutions like DCP that will be removed.</p>

</blockquote>

<h2 align="left">Pre-compilation and Pre-generation and Caching</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left">The cache system in Cocoon1 will be ported with no important
  design changes since it's very flexible and was not polluted by early design
  constraints since it appeared in later versions. The issue regards static file
  caching that, no matter what, will always be slower than direct web server
  caching.</p>
  <p align="left">To be able to put most of the static part job back on the web
  server (where it belongs), Cocoon2 will greatly improve it's command line
  operation, allowing the creation of <i>site makefiles</i> that will
  automatically scan the web site and the source documents and will provide a
  way to <i>regenerate</i> the static part of a web site (images and tables
  included!) based on the same XML model used in the dynamic operation version.</p>
  <p align="left">It will be up to the web server administrator to use static
  regeneration capabilities on a time basis, manually or triggered by some
  particular event (database update signal) since Cocoon2 will only provide
  servlet and command line capabilities. The nice integration is based on the
  fact that there will be no behavioral difference if the files are dynamically
  generated in Cocoon2 via the servlet operation and cached internally or
  pre-generated and served directly by the web server, as long as URI contracts
  are kept the same by the system administrator (via URL-rewriting or aliasing)</p>
  <p align="left">Also, it will be possible to avoid on-fly page and stylesheet
  compilation (which make debugging harder) with command line pre-compilation
  hooks that will work like normal compilers from a developer's point of view.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 align="left">Conclusions</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left">Cocoon2 is a big and very ambitious project, not only for the
  technological issues involved (which will require strong integration with XML
  components) but also for the significant paradigm shifts imposed by the new
  technologies. On the other hand, we strongly believe this to be the winner
  model for future web engineering and if you believe in this yourself, we
  invite you to join us or help us in any way you can provide.</p>
  <p align="left">Thank you all for reading this far and, finally, the Cocoon2
  motto: kick ass or die! :-)</p>
