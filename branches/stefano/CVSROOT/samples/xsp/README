This directory shows an example of the proposed XSP specification (see
the documentation for more information).

This is just to show its power and _WON'T_ work on currently distributed Cocoon
no matter how hard you try, unless you implement the XSP engine alone.

But since we are already doing that, we'll be happy if you want to give us
a hand.
