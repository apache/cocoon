                       This is the infamous Cocoon2
                       ----------------------------
                       
Make yourself at home :)

This is a new generation and open source dynamics loves continuum rather than
jagged steps. So it will be a difficult process to move on, but we need to do
it.

So, this is more or less a whiteboard at this point where everyone adds its
own features and tries with new interfaces without compromising anyones job.

But this is so only until we find a solidity around our interfaces and then
stop writing stuff.

CAREFUL: three anti-patterns should be highly avoided

 - "the 2.0 antipattern": stuff all possible features you can in 2.0
 - "the golden hammer antipattern": use "xxx" for everything
 - "the flexibility syndrome": if it isn't symmetrical make it so
 
Let's do things better, but do not try to solve the world's problems with
Cocoon 2.0, we _will_ have Cocoon 3.0 to start over again :)
