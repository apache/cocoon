  What is it?
  -----------

  Cocoon is a 100% pure Java publishing framework that relies on
  new W3C technologies (such as XML and XSL) to provide web content.

  The Cocoon project aims to change the way web information is created,
  rendered and delivered. This new paradigm is based on fact that document
  content, style and logic are often created by different individuals or
  working groups.

  Cocoon aims to a complete separation of the three layers, allowing the
  three layers to be indipendently designed, created and managed, reducing
  management overhead, increasing work reuse and reducing time to market.
