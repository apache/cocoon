		<p>As I find that there is enough information about XSP available (only
		  not together), I give you a list of pointers in the sequence you should read
		  them.</p> 
		<ol>
		  <li>Get Cocoon 2 <link href="install.html">up and running</link>. Surf
		to <code>[webhost]/cocoon/slides/slides?section=4</code> and following. This
		gives you a first insight in the XSP ground idea.</li>
		<li>Read the XSP Logicsheets page. This tells you how to use and make
		  your own XSP logicsheets and XSP pages.</li>
		<li>If you're still hungry for more, read the XSP Internals page. This
		  describes how XSP's are handled internally by Cocoon 2.</li>
