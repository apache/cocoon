 <question>
   Cocoon won't start and I get a &quot;java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.apache.log.LogKit: method
   createLogger(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/apache/log/Logger;
   not found&quot; in my Servlet Container's log.
 </question>
 <answer>
   <p>
     You have an old set of libraries installed.  Copy the correct libraries from the
     distribution.
   </p>
   <p>
     Even better, if you build Cocoon with "build -Dinclude.webapp.libs webapp" then
     Cocoon will create a complete WAR file for you with all necessary libraries.

   Cocoon still won't start, this time I get 
javax.xml.transform.TransformerConfigurationException: Namespace not supported by SAXParser
   in the Cocoon log file.
 </question>
 <answer>
   <p>
     This is a classloader issue with Tomcat and some other Servlet Engines.  Basically
     it means that the Xerces library included with Cocoon is not being found.  The solution
     is to place the Xerces library first in the classpath.

   I have a J2EE server and I want to use the J2eeDataSource that the docs said was available.
   When I try to use it, I get a ClassNotFoundException.
 </question>
 <answer>
   <p>
     When you build Cocoon, you need the package that has JNDI and the JDBC Extensions in
     the classpath.  The build script automatically determines if they exist.  You can place
     a copy directly in the &quot;lib&quot; directory and rebuild Cocoon.  The missing class
     should now be there.
