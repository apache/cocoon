  <p>
   Cocoon2 is a complete rewrite of the Cocoon XML publishing framework that
   is supposed to remove all those design constraint that emerged from the
   Cocoo1 experience.
  </p>

  <p>
   This documentation is alpha, like anything else, so don't expect
   that much. If you are not a developer and you are not willing to test
   new stuff that may not work as expected, we suggest you to refer to the latest
   Cocoon1 release which is very stable.
  </p>

  <p>
   Otherwise, if you are brave enough, we welcome you into this new world of XML wonders :-)
