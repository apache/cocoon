  All user accessible points in this software package are to be considered
  "alpha". This means that the developer team is not investing _any_ effort
  in providing back compatibility between alpha releases.
  
  This software will continue to be release as "alpha" until both code, schemas
  and APIs will be considered stable.
  
  Until than, there will be no warranty that newer version will maintain back
  compatibility even in the most simple cases.
  
  On the other hand, once "beta" status is reached, back incompatible changes
  will be made only if necessary to reach the "final" status.
  
  The Cocoon developer team understands the importance of reliable
  software as well as the importance of protecting user investiments by the
  creation of a solid development platform that doesn't change.

  On the other hand, being the Cocoon project a pioneer in many fields and 
  being most of the technologies used at a "working draft" phase only, this
  cannot be guaranteed before a final status is reached for the software.
  
  Until then, no effort will be provided for back compatibility.
  
  You have been warned.
