  You have downloaded Cocoon and you don't like to read verbose docs, right?
  
  Great, this file is for you.
  
 
 1) Have your Servlet 2.2 compatible servlet engine installed.
  
  If you don't know how to do this, well, stop right here and move to the 
  Apache Tomcat project (http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/) then come back
  when you are done.

  Done? Ok, let's go on.

  
 2) Set your JAVA_HOME enviornment
  
  You have to set your JAVA_HOME enviornment to point to the root directory of
  the Java Development Kit installed on your machine. To do this simply type:
  
    [unix] JAVA_HOME=/path/to/java/
    [win32] SET JAVA_HOME=c:\path\to\java

  your mileage may vary, but you know how to setup enviornments, right?

  
 3) Create the Cocoon WAR package.
  
  To do this you simply have to type, depending on your operating system
  
    [unix]  ./build.sh  -Dinclude.webapp.libs=yes webapp
    [win32] .\build.bat -Dinclude.webapp.libs=yes webapp
  
  this will create the "cocoon.war" file in the './build/cocoon' directory.


 4) Install the WAR package in your servlet container.
  
  There is no standard way to do this, but in most servlet engines, this is 
  just a matter of copying the war file in a specific directory and the
  engine will take care of installing it when restarted. 
  
  For Apache Tomcat, you have to copy the WAR archive into the '/webapps'
  directory so do
  
    [unix] cp ./build/cocoon/cocoon.war $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/cocoon.war
    [unix] copy .\build\cocoon\cocoon.war %TOMCAT_HOME%\webapps\cocoon.war
  
  where TOMCAT_HOME points to the directory where tomcat is installed (note:
  you don't need to set it in the enviornment, it's there only to show you)


 5) Restart the servlet engine.


 6) Access the URI 'http://localhost/cocoon/' with your favorite browser

 
 7) Wait a few seconds (Cocoon needs to compile parts of itself when launched)
 

 8) Say hallo to Cocoon :)
  


  FAQ
  ---
  
  1) Why nothing happens when I access 'http://localhost/cocoon/'?

  You might want to check a few things:
  
   - is your server listening to port 80? if not, you have to call the right
     port like in 'http://localhost:8080/cocoon/'. Note that Apache Tomcat
     binds by default to port 8080, NOT 80.
     
   - did your servlet engine install the WAR file? you can check by making
     sure the WAR file was unpacked or connecting to the administration tools
     of your servlet engine.
     
   - did you restart the servlet engine? if not, do it.
   
   
  2) Why does Cocoon takes so long to start?
  
  Cocoon compiles sitemaps into java classes to increase runtime performance,
  this is done only at startup and only if the sitemap file is modified, for 
  all the other requests the compiled sitemap is executed.
  
 
  3) Why is cocoon.war so big?
  
  Cocoon.war includes all the libraries that it requires to run. They are 
  several megabytes of Java classes and it also includes the JDK javac compiler
  which must be present in the war file to allow page compilation without 
  classloading problems.
  

  4) I'm still stuck, what do I do?
  
  Well, contact the Cocoon Users mail list (cocoon-users@xml.apache.org).
  Please, do not contact developers directly for help since the user list are
  normally much more responsive and users normally have more experience in
  solving installation problems than developers do.

  
  Happy hacking with Apache Cocoon.
