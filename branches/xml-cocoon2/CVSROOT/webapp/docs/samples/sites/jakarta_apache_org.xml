   The goal of the Jakarta Project is to provide commercial-quality
   server solutions based on the Java Platform that are developed in an
   open and cooperative fashion.
  </p>
     
  <p>
   The Jakarta Project has nothing to do, nor condones, the unfortunate
   situtation in East Timor. For more information about why the project
   is named &quot;Jakarta&quot; <a href="naming.html">click here</a>.

  <section title="Tomcat: Java Servlets and JavaServer Pages Reference Implementation">
   <p>
    The flagship product, Tomcat, is a world-class implementation of the
    Java Servlet 2.2 and JavaServer Pages 1.1 Specifications. This
    implementation will be used in the Apache Web Server as well as in
    other web servers and development tools.
   </p>
     
   <p>
    The Tomcat Implementation is currently in beta form. We are working
    diligently on merging the current Apache Jserv Project's source code
    with the Sun code. We expect to have a final release of Tomcat by the
    end of 1999. To learn more about the various Tomcat releases, <a
