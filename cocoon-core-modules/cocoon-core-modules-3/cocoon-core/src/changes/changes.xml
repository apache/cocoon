    <release version="2.2.0-M3-SNAPSHOT" date="2007-00-00" description="unreleased">
      <action dev="dfagerstrom" type="update">
        Refactoring to make the pipelines usable outside the tree processor:
          (1) The source resolver in AbstractProcessingPipeline is looked up from the service 
              manager that is inserted with the setProcessorManager instead of from the 
              EnvironmentHelper.getCurrentProccessor method. After having traced the call 
              sequence it seem to be equivalent and from testing it seem to work.
          (2) Changed the return type SitemapErrorHandler.prepareErrorHandler to Processing 
              pipeline which is the same as it in Cocoon 2.1.x. Before the pipeline was embedded 
              in a descriptor object. The only use for that in the pipeline context was that 
              it was used for having a refernce to the container that created the pipeline and 
              could use that for releasing the pipeline. But in the Spring Avalon implementation 
              the release method is a noop.

        Cocoon becomes a normal Spring application which means that it is initialized by
        Spring and not the other way around.
