    <release version="2.2.1" date="TBA" description="unreleased">
      <action dev="joerg" type="add">
        Allow multiple file uploads of the same field name. If there are multiple file uploads Request.get(String) will
        return a Vector. If there is only one file upload it will return the Part as it did before. This is now the same
        behavior as for inline parts.
      </action>
    </release>
    <release version="2.2.0" date="TBA" description="released">
      <action dev="joerg" type="fix">

        multiple times.

    <release version="2.2.0-M3" date="2007-03-02" description="released">
      <action dev="dfagerstrom" type="update">
        Refactoring to make the pipelines usable outside the tree processor:
        <ul>
          <li>The source resolver in AbstractProcessingPipeline is looked up from the service
              manager that is inserted with the setProcessorManager instead of from the
              EnvironmentHelper.getCurrentProccessor method. After having traced the call
              sequence it seem to be equivalent and from testing it seem to work.</li>
          <li>Changed the return type SitemapErrorHandler.prepareErrorHandler to Processing
              pipeline which is the same as it in Cocoon 2.1.x. Before the pipeline was embedded
              in a descriptor object. The only use for that in the pipeline context was that
              it was used for having a refernce to the container that created the pipeline and
              could use that for releasing the pipeline. But in the Spring Avalon implementation
              the release method is a noop.</li>

    <release version="2.2.0-M2" date="2007-02-11" description="released">
      <action dev="cziegeler" type="update">
        Cocoon becomes a normal Spring application which means that it is initialized by
        Spring and not the other way around.
