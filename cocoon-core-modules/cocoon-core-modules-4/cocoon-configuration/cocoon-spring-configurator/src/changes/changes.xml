    <release version="1.0.1" date="2007-00-00" description="unreleased">
      <action dev="cziegeler" type="fix">
        SettingsBeanFactoryPostProcessor can be used outside a servlet context.
      </action>
      <action dev="reinhard" type="fix">
        WebAppContextUtils stored a Spring parent application context in a static field. This
        made it impossible to reload the context. The static field was removed and a request
        for the parent context results in 
        WebApplicationContextUtils.getRequiredWebApplicationContext(ServletContext)
        which returns the parent Spring application context stored in the servlet context.
      </action>             
      <action dev="cziegeler" type="add">
        Each property reference can have an optional default value, like
        ${my.property.net:THE DEFAULT}. If no other definition for this
        property is found, the default is used.
      </action>  
      <action dev="cziegeler" type="add">
        Add a bean map that collects all beans from the Spring context
        conforming to a specified type.
      </action>
      <action dev="cziegeler" type="add">
        Improved the DefaultBlockResourcesHolder to act like a PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer.
        This allows access to the path of the deployed blocks in the configuration files
        through properties like ${org.apache.cocoon.blocks.[BLOCK_NAME].resources}.
      </action>      
      <action dev="cziegeler" type="add">
        Initial creation.
