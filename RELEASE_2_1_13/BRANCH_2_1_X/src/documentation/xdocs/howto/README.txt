Filename conventions
How-To files in this directory should follow the following naming convention:

    howto-<descriptive-name-here>.xml

Use hyphens between any words which follow "howto-". Please make sure your name will be sufficiently unique to distinguish it from future contributions. For example, if you are committing a how-to about Actions, don't name it howto-actions.xml. 

Multi-page How-Tos
If you are adding in a multi-page How-To to this directory please create a subdirectory with the same name as the main page of your How-To, minus the beginning phrase "howto-" and the ending phrase ".xml". Add "-<step number>" within filenames for pages which represent additional How-To steps.
