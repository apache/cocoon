        <para>
            Shows that mounted pass-through breaks when a "cocoon:" is used
            after going back to the parent sitemap (<link
                href="http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=33178">bug
                #33178</link>).

        <para>
            Test links:
            <ul>
                <li><link href="welcome">Direct pipeline</link></li>
                <li><link href="welcome1">One "cocoon:" URL</link></li>
                <li><link href="welcome2">Two chained "cocoon:" URLs</link></li>
                <li><link href="welcome3">Three chained "cocoon:" URLs</link></li>

        <para>
           A "cocoon:" called within a pass-trough mount leading to no match reported an NPE
           rather than a ResourceNotFound. With the bugfix, the RNFE is catched, and the "welcome"
	   page is displayed.
