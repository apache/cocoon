This directory contains the instrumentation client that allows to remotely
monitor the behaviour of a running Cocoon.

To activate Cocoon instrumentation, uncomment the "enable-instrumentation"
and "instrumentation-config" servlet parameters in web.xml.

To start the GUI, type "build start-instrumentation-client" in the main
Cocoon directory, then use "Instrument manager/Connect to instrument manager"
to establish a connection with the Cocoon server.
