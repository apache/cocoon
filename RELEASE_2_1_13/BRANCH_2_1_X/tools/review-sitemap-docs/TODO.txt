* Ensure that the SitemapTask is finding all possible components.

* The script tools/review-sitemap-docs/correlate-table.sh
also attempts to compare the lists obtained from SitemapTask
with a list obtained from scanning javadocs. The latter list
is also finding some junk, so more exclusions may need to
be added to find-component-java-files-exclude.txt
