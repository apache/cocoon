    <release version="1.2.0-SNAPSHOT" date="2008-??-??" description="unreleased">
      <action dev="reinhard" type="add">
        ServletUrlConnection correctly implements #getHeaderFields() instead of relying on the NOP implementation of HttpURLConnection.
      </action>
      <action dev="gkossakowski" type="fix">
        Fixed NPE thrown by HttpServletResponseBufferingWrapper and ServletServiceResponse after resetBuffer() method was called.
      </action>
      <action dev="gkossakowski" type="update">
        Java 5 as minimum requirement.
      </action>    
      <action dev="gkossakowski" type="fix" issue="COCOON-2237">
        Fixed HttpServletResponseBufferingWrapper implementation so it does not throw IllegalStateException
        when resestBufferedResponse is being called.
      </action>
      <action dev="gkossakowski" type="fix" issue="COCOON-2236">
        ServletFactoryBean will install JNet handlers before calling init() method
        of Servlet that is being created. This should make SSF compatible with Cocoon Core 2.2.0 again.
      </action>
    </release>
    <release version="1.1.0" date="2008-08-09" description="released">
      <action dev="reinhard" type="fix">
        The dependency on the Cocoon SourceResolver, that introduced a circular dependency with Cocoon 2.2, was
        removed. The Cocoon SourceResolver was used to resolve URLs in the context-path attribute of a servlet
        bean definition. After the change the Servlet-Service framework only relies on the default URL handling
        of the JVM. In order to dynamically support different URLStreamHandlers, it is recommended to use 
        Cocoon JNet.
      </action>    
      <action dev="reinhard" type="fix">
        Fix the lastModified() method of the ServletConnection: make sure that there is an existing connection 
        before reading the Last-Modified header 
      </action>    
      <action dev="reinhard" type="add">
        Add a ServletURLConnection, ServletURLStreamHandler and a ServletURLStreamHandlerFactory to provide 
        support for service: URLs.
      </action>    
      <action dev="gkossakowski" type="fix" issue="COCOON-2150">
        Fixed bug in ServletServiceContext that was responsible for errors on resetting response that was already committed.
        Now the Servlet-Service framework buffers response but only if 404 status code has been set.
        This allows to reset the response safely.
      </action>

    <release version="1.0.0" date="2008-04-07" description="unreleased">

      </action>
      <action dev="reinhard" type="add">
        The "+" character is not allowed at the end of connection names anymore. Starting
        Cocoon will fail hard with a RuntimeException if this rule is broken. See
        org.apache.cocoon.servletservice.spring.ServletDecorator.

      <action dev="reinhard" type="add" issue="COCOON-2154">

        The ServletServiceResponse inherits the request attributes, request parameters and the session
        from the caller.

        Throw an exception when circular dependencies in servlet connections are detected.
      </action>
      <action dev="gkossakowski" type="fix">
      	DispatcherServlet does not throw an exception if it fails to find suitable servlet for processing incomming request.
      	It returns 404 error and puts information to log about the failure, instead.
