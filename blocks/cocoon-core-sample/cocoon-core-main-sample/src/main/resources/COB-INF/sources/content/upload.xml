  <title>Demonstrate file upload as source</title>
  <content>
    <para>
      Hi there! I'm a simple static page read from a file, but that's not the
      interesting part of this sample.  Select any xml file from your local
      drive, and upload it.  The resulting page will display that xml transformed
      by a stylesheet (which could also be provided via upload).
    </para>
    <para>
      You must have configured enable-uploads as true in web.xml or built Cocoon
      with the config.enable-uploads=true property set for this sample to work.

      <form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data" action="xml-upload-post">
        File:
        <input type="file" name="formFieldOne" size="50"/>
        <p>
          <input type="submit" value="Upload File"/>
