    <note>
      Request processing in the Cocoon consists of several phases.
      First one is pipeline assembly phase, when sitemap processor
      traverses sitemaps, finds, and builds a pipeline for the
      request.
    </note>
    <note>
      Second phase is the pipeline setup phase, when pipeline is
      initialized with the request parameters.
    </note>
    <note>
      Third phase is the pipeline execution phase, when generator
      starts streaming SAX events down the pipeline, which end up
      in the serializer, writing bytes into the output stream.
