    <sample name="Catalog Entity Resolver" href="catalog/">
      XML is handy but also very complex. Cocoon integrates a number of
      facilities to help you during your journey through XML-land. One of these
      is the centralized handling of resolving network resources
      (e.g. DTDs, symbols, character entity sets, images) to local copies
      through the use of catalogs. Also explains how to use DocBook DTDs.
