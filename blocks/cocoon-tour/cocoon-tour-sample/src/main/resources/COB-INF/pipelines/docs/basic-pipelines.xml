        <h2>Minimal pipeline</h2>
        <p>
            Our first pipeline uses the RequestGenerator to output the request
            attributes in XML.
        </p>

        <h3>Sitemap excerpt</h3>
        <cinclude:include element="xml-code" src="cocoon:/xml-element/pipelines/sitemap.xmap/requestPipeline"/>

        <h3>Typical output</h3>
        <p>
            Shown below is the result of a request to <a href="../dump-request?param=xyz">dump-request?param=xyz</a>.
            The response is XML as specified by the serializer, and describes the request attributes and parameters,
            converted to XML by the RequestGenerator component.
        </p>

        <cinclude:include element="xml-code" src="cocoon:/pipelines/dump-request?param=xyz"/>

        <h2>Converting XML to HTML</h2>
        <p>
            Adding a transformer with map:transform and changing the serializer
            to HTML allows us to generate HTML out of the XML of the previous example.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can also view the output here: <a href="../request.html">request.html</a>
        </p>

        <h3>Sitemap excerpt</h3>
        <cinclude:include element="xml-code" src="cocoon:/xml-element/pipelines/sitemap.xmap/requestToHtml"/>

        <h3>XSL transformation</h3>
        <cinclude:include element="xml-code" src="cocoon:/xml-element/pipelines/xsl/request-to-html.xsl/main"/>

        <h3>Typical output</h3>
        <cinclude:include element="xml-code" src="cocoon:/pipelines/request.html"/>

        <h2>Adding a touch of style</h2>
        <p>
            You can chain several transformers in a pipeline. In this example we add
            some style to our HTML by adding an additional XSL transform.
        </p>
