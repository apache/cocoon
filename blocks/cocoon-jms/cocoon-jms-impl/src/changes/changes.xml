        JMS block: Connection failures can now be recovered from. The default JMSConnectionManager implementation
        detects when JMS connections are severed and schedules reconnection attempts with the cron scheduler
        in order to re-establish the connection. As soon as reconnection was successful it notifies its listeners
        so that they may recover as well and refresh their JMS sessions. The provided abstract MessageListener
        and JMS publisher that users are recommended to use as base classes for their concrete JMS needs have been
        updated to use this mechanism.
