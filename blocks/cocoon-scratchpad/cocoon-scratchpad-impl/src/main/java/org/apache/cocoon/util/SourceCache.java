/**
 * A source cache caches Objects that are created from a source. It handles
 * transparently rereading sources and recreation of objects if the source
 * validity has expired or the object has been cleaned from the cache. For 
 * this, a reloader callback needs to be registered that actually does the
 * recreation of the cached object.
 * 
 * <p>Example:</p>
 * <pre>
 * 
 *   public void service(ServiceManager manager) {
 *      ...
 *      // obtain source cache on startup / service / initialize
 *      SourceCache cache = (SourceCache) manager.lookup(SourceCache.ROLE);
 *      // register reloader
 *      // with anonymous class handling the callback
 *      cache.register( new SourceReloader() { 
 *                 public Object reload(Source src, Object param) {
 *                     return refresh(src, (String) param[0], (Integer) param[1] );
 *                 });
 *   }
 *  
 *   // have callback method. Private is OK because its used from a anonymous
 *   // nested class.
 *   private CreatedObject refresh(Source src, String param1, Integer param2) {
 *      ...
 *   }
 *
 * 
 *   public void foo() {
 *      ...
 *      // use cache
 *      CreatedObject foo = (CreatedObject) cache.getObject(resolver, key, uri, 
 *      ...                                                    Object[] { param1, new Integer(param2) });
 *   }
 * 
 *   public void dispose() {
 *      // release source cache on dispose
 *      manager.release(cache);
 *   }
 * 
 * </pre>
